So basically I've started dictating to my computer what I need 'cause, you know, and I need to disclose something here. I need to mute everything to write stars. OK guys, you can hear me, but I'm trying to. OK, basically Yup, I can do to my computer anytime. So basically guys this is a very important here. You understand what I'm doing now, but I need you guys to really get with it. So let me try to start now. My videos OK basically I've fixed my camera. I'm seeing my camera now. Can you hear me yourself is good to go. OK, so I've got the some notes here, but you know it's all for my head. This is like this morning what today's date is to the 3rd of November. Start orgasm. I work too 'cause you know what is the workplace? They just like people work. But you know, I put them down on people. Get to the next. But this time it's gonna be a serious thing about my civil collapse initiative. So we got a triadic models only. But you know, every new system has a trigger model. So two things basically, you know, three teams, Muslim people here. Basically this is something I told the wingman between there's no, there's no sun shining on it like, you know, with you at the sun. It's like a, it's like a sunshine run. It's like a sun or something goes one way, but it's one way, one of the sun because I'm trying to interpret the world my way now. So the sun shines in some places. So when it shows sign, things get better, You know, 'cause it means you have more capacity and more energy. You have more dates, more to do because the sun lost. But the sun doesn't last forever. Every day, 24 hours a day, what do you do? 24 hours. Sunrises it then goes down. So if you're struggling. So for the dear friend son, the writing son, the BFF writing son item 'cause I'm seriously playing I'm taking back my my my, my persona myself from the best side. So guys, this is about. Safety critical systems, I don't spell it for you, but you know this transmit is rubbish anyway you can transfer to different rubbish. So, So you got a song. It rises on day, night and day, night and day. Or if you don't start anything you say very important if you don't stand this night and day already, if you don't understand anything, understand what I'm doing on this paper. About war stuff, war tech, fighting tech. OK, so the sun rises this moon, the sun becomes a Half Moon. The Half Moon becomes what a a like a moon. It's like a it's like a Croatian. It's like a great croissant. It's like a Hoffman. This is another try like a trimming, trimming, a little trimming. Let me look at the moon. But so we get the moon what you get the sun on the other side. So on the side of the sleep, the moon is the sun, you know. But you know, just because the tires going doesn't mean the moon is not there. So the moon is there definitely definitely just you don't. So the moon swan, the moon is night and day. So this way you understand night and day. So here we have what the sea, only the sea. So here because, you know, give it basically on the land, you know, with different, you know, we're fighting for like the bite of beer for. So this is very important to me to waking up. So this kind of land is there, you know, by the time of day, it's so hard to so it's so like hard to keep track of. Loose truck very quickly because you know once the sunsets you know the good night and day then you go to sleep and you wake up but when you're sick you don't want to wake to sleep. You know you want to stay awake the best possible in cycles. So the sun has 123 that's what you have like 4 days 24 o'clock because you know everything speaking three. I didn't try it anyway so. This is like a what interest is a triangle model, the triangle model. So basically you got another get to see the triangle model, but you don't do it with your eyes, you do with your all the senses. You know the boat's shipping out. You have to know what you're doing. The multiple should get in the day. You know it's not. Basically you want to do the most important thing. In the morning, which is when the moon comes in or the day is the moon is night, moon day. So basically in 12 hours Standard Time is what the default for normal day. But you know, 24 hours Standard Time is multiple. But you know, this is a problem. This is duality, I'm calling it. So basically this man, radical rational. Framework I'm reading around why I'm not getting things done. You know why I'm not doing stuff to how I'm doing stuff. So this might work my ontological revelation. So I love this guy's team because you love this like me. If you don't love it, you know barefoot, you don't stand the sun meaning in the barefoot you don't understand. So, so if you don't love it, you know, then you know, or you have something that doesn't make sense to me, just tell me and I'll try to mix it with the system better for everyone. So this is a 12 hour system, not just to the four hour system. Now in four hours is military time, but it gives you more time, more time, but more time to what in the sea if you're fighting, you know. Fight more time to fight, but don't move them to fight. Why haven't you done it in 12 hour time? You know you haven't done it in 12 hour time. So basically in 12 hours, you know, 12 hours minimum you to like defend the vital breakfast. You know, I love myself, you know. So when the sun then comes, you know, get the the sunrise, the sunrise, so the sunrise. And then the sun goes, obviously the sun, and then you get this one, go this way and then you get this one. And you get half the sun and you get sunset. So sunrise to sundown. So let's go like moonlight. These are the same thing there, you know, the same thing in the day. You know, when is basically one is one song sunset in the sun, barefoot sunrise, you know, you know about the sun rising doesn't seem to get that's what we have a time model there, but you know. Busily 24 hour **** is stupid anyway, there's not basically I'm trying to change the track which is gonna be working there. You know, if you have if you want to, you know, but you know if you're working for for the people in you with us, you know So this 24 hour this is stupid time. Military triumph you know if i was just rubbish i hit it i hit it when i when I talk, I was there per day in Biafra anyway, so we used 12:00 Standard Time. For certain. So now my different constitution, we have 6 hours maximum a day to work now that's what we can work 6 hours a day, which is what it wasn't different Nigeria until I start working 7 hours as a child. But you know you said I had to get to pay my dad. So basically my daughter will be going with me through more work so I could do it. So this six hours. But you know, because you have 5 to 6 hours, you know. Child wants to work, you know they don't need to work so that's allowed like everyone else to smoke 6 hours a day, you know that's half day. Oh sorry, sorry that's wrong. Basically 6 hours a day it's half days. So I booked half day. I didn't want to work half day because by that meeting 7 sorry, they meant what you know allowed only. Have they? So a child is half an adult, a adult. OK, basically I'm thinking of genes right now so I'm giving you guys properly. So a child is half an adult, but that's where I can be man or woman, boy if a man wants, if not boy wants to work more out to come. But a man expects to become a man, so they need to work hours. So basically. Our child was only three to six hours naturally, but you know, I do. I didn't like it in school, but if I want to do something else, six hours is the account six hours of child. So basically I want you to like 3 hours or less. 3 hours unless Why? Why? Because you know. 1/4 of the day of 12 is what, 3 three hours maximum? That's the maximum you're not working. No if no, but as a as as a as a. As a child, so the minimum time the child you know is 3 hours, you know, per day for your family, for your work day, three hours a day. You know, we have to get money, something to get something from it. You know what is money? It's not basically can get money. You can get money from his children. Money for me, but you don't want to get money. I just want to buy some foods. You get basically someone, you get to watch the what you need, what you need, So what what you want. Basically you just type in the model here. So you see what I'm saying? The sun is going to move. There's no difference. You know, you can work in the day, you can work in the night, you know. But you know, you guys are meant to work with the person that you are. You get paid for, you know, I want you just to working on it. We don't want to work. I want to get reviews, you know, this time the whole time. So time is of the essence for you guys, you know, so if you're like. MMM, obviously you have. I don't tell anybody 5 to work. So basically when I start working, I started working at. Age of 5. That's so I don't know what this favors will be doing in the shop, you know so basically I don't want to like tell you guys this, but I don't want you guys. I want you guys to like you know, the children to be working at age 5 'cause you know Peggy system. So you got honestly got honestly 123 is banned from working anyway. The truck is a child turned 5 and 6 and you. You want to work. You know, see, I said yes, yes, you know, and he said Are you sure you want to work 'cause it's not going back if you say yes again, yes guys, that's for the children. But if you say I need to sign them up, so basically you have to see them, confirm them by video, like you know, video 123. Uh, yes, it says 3 yeses. Yes. Why 'cause you know, if you make a mistake, we don't make a mistake once. They call themselves a second time if they make a purchase, but you know, that's for the verbal or, or, or neurodivergent people, you know, and then you go to. So you have to do 3 * 3 times. See some the maximum of 6 times, you see that? No, but you know they see it, but they write it on paper. The document is basically the form just filling 3 forms, 3 forms, independent forms, not even like together guys, these are very fine. You know, if I make it 12 forms, you know better for you guys, you know, let's say 3 to 6 forms. Because as a child you know 3 forms is like so 3 to 9 phones for. Because 3 * 3 three times in a day is they can work 3 * 3 two plus 360. So 6 forms could have to fill in six 6 plus 633 forms. When they say it video audio they heard but they said 3 + 3. But they need three of them to verify people. So you don't want to work minimal hours. You do form send a form and then say it in person. I'll get a audio recording because anybody's sued by a child guys not embarrassing for you guys and they get sex but the maximum allowed to work 6 times and they get to work and do it with them. But they're allowed to work on the half the time. So if. With an adult 6 how do i work so i'll do 6 12 hours a day, basically I'm allowed to work 12 hours a day. You know, I don't want to spend one more hour working my life like, you know, working for who, not who who who I for myself. So 12 hours a day, 6 + 6 is 12. So that's a minimum I'm allowed to work. A lot, but they don't want to work in the So basically I want to get like a six hours work 'cause you know, I try to do 6 hours a day anyway 'cause this is a day, but you know, that's just six hours past. This was birthday 6 * 6 is what, 36 hours a day? So most people going basically, I don't want you to see how the work to do, you know, 'cause I mean system is broken, you know? So there should be no one working sequences. I was just working like a a 6 + 6 out there. 12 hours day maximum, no maximum a day maximum. If you never want to do overnight, that's day cover day and night. You know whatever they were doing that day and night covered two hours. If you're able to walk to the six hours they are, they are crazy. They could something wrong with the system. Who lost the people? So that's kind of intelligent duality. So Charles loved obviously a child, a young woman, a woman basically tried 3 forms. A young woman is what's allowed to work a young girl basically if I'm meant to work 6 hours a day. As a as a child, you can shoot through. I'm not scared of you guys shouldn't because you don't. If you want to work, you don't want to. It's fine. But you know you're going to work with something you want. So six hours is maximum. Now I get 3 hours a day. Uh, questionnaire, Uh, two to six? Umm, how's it it follow? Unless you keep them, them having money in their pockets and money and doing things. So basically this wallet is called Why go to the psycho duality? I want to do something but I don't have to do it. So you can buy assets so they're more interested to access to. They basically audio systems, basically a child can have more assets basically than adults they need. So basically, you know, I don't know what I need. I need money. The money is there, but the money is not there. It's a month to get fit. But you know, that's my food, guys. That's my food. My food is a chocolate. I bought a food, I buy a loaf of bread, a bread. I don't, I don't know, I didn't put the bread. I don't have to buy milk. If I can do more work for milk and I do money milk and then there's something nice. Money food for food, not like rice, jello, fries for the for for the week. So I'm doing a lot to work weekly only Week 2 weekly. So they have two weeks to work or one week off, you know, 2 to 1. So so this is 3 weeks. So basically if they if they ever worked three weeks, they were basically 3:00 to. Work with the right model, but this is very much the street work to shoot right now. And the two to three weeks are to work maximum. So that's the one days so that we have to take the entire next week off, you know, 'cause you know, but then you can do that, that maximum 3 to 1. You don't want to keep it like that. They then work the next week in for like a week, a second, a second, you know, like you know this name working like a Monday. They allowed to if they want to. They look for a day because we care for these children now because it can be very smart a day after the week. That's been one day, 20 + 21 day, 22 days. That means they need that one day back one day back and what we need to do is to give them that break. You know, they're not allowed to work. You guys should be actually stopping them. So my system should block them entirely by daily. So my system allowed them to show to be blocked entirely from entering that environment to work. They don't allow it in there for that time. You know that that's a good something else. You know so it's. Healing people's Italy by making sure this way I don't say I'm busy. I'm running you guys. But I'm not saying I'm running you guys. I'm saying you work for me. I'm not saying you work for me, I'm saying you work for me. No, no, I don't want that. I say do your work, guys. No, I don't like it OK when I say you. Basically when you say I work for you and that means I'm not happy you're control me, I'm a slave. So this is what this one means. You know I'm not free, but work is labor. Labour is tiresome. You become tiresome, but it's not it's about liberty about independence. So only basically this so this thing I went to Lucas system. So what I want to introduce you guys is something that. Oh my time. 03 minutes. MMUKOM for mother, M for Mike. If I'm imagining Anthem, Mike U for Umbrella, K for Kilo and O for Oscar, it's the zygote coherence system. But you know, it's really about pushing all the kids, you know, so you know, civil class civilization. So basically. A civil collapse is what so basically the mucosystem, what obviously mucous children services, you know healthcare, you know basically you want to do themselves. You know you want basically I don't need to be with children, you know, like any adults would be with the children shouldn't go to the shop. They didn't think stop holding the kids hands, guys. Stop putting my hand. I want to say I want a house guys. No, my mom and. Basically this is the MUCO, you know, initiative. So basically this. OK, So what my initial game, the one I will, the children's will go, the zygote will, the zygote will and then we got. Muco mucocycle. Uh, so muco we can go to uh, muco onion, onion. So this is muco onion. And because I got so system, so you got the wheel and we must keep moving, you know, without the adults, without the adults, without the adults with us. I'm holding my hand again. The child duality, Adult to man. Not sure. Hold my hand ever again, you know. We'll it's my universe now and we almost keep moving the roads are broken on broken roads are the worst roads for a child is distressed killing massacre a 1967 war TO1920003000. Present day, 30 years old, 50 years old, an ongoing and still going 'cause it's not really just moving. And then what? Duality. Now rediscovered so basically the children of Red House should rediscover themselves the zygote discovery we they can do spread basically the most brilliant life into them. So basically this zygote quality. So basically should I basically we we have the right to hear, but we should have a worse. So the thing about this basically. To breathe, but it's not an option. It's an option every time was breathe. The mother wants to breathe more. Breathe, you know, it's not. It's a suffering. If there will be an enemy, the dead, if they'll be any child I've seen breathing, it's not sure. OK, you model now. Mr. We're using this this Lego wheel and I got a problem. So basically the model, everything I see there is problematic. So I'm trying to give it to you breathe. Live from worker. OK so this is need. I need to. And this is something called the dynamic scale. So basically it's called a dynamic scale. Need to want, need to want and then. Aspirational foundation to aspirational You know what's your local name? We go more. OK, basically guys, this is like also strip back here. I mean magazine is going to try to get a softer too. So let me try to give you that. So this is the build that so you can see these people that want 2/3. Me 'cause i'm just gonna do my PH D's my PH D's mythological revolution for children even though the mothers or the fathers, you know, 'cause I wanted to be independence, a flush with a man or woman, 'cause, you know, I see women as men, but they are do not have men. They are women that can give life and protect things. But you know they can take them because you put you indirectly. So basically it's more indirect, but what can it be? Direct means you protect everyone directly without saying to someone else. There's empower to do it. So I think my wife who talks to me when she wanna she wanna solve a problem. Once I saw the problem with other wives, you know what she's having a hustle or not. I don't have but I want 2 wives someone 2 wives don't want anything were from the Nigeria 'cause you know that I'm not really necessarily. So basically the breathing is not optional. That's but the breathing problems overlap with what the life problems and the life problems of work problems. So basically breathing, you need air, you need food, you need water. You know, since you survive, turn the knife to life. You need life into it, into your sleep. You need to be waking up cycle and doing work. Now the work is an optional framework. So you're not allowed to work if you don't want to work. You know work is an option. You can work to get some money to see and stuff. But you know that same thing. Do I, I need to see something? This is just the first error. If you see someone say this is the model you, you, you breathe your life and you live your work a **** model. So you get a second model here. This is this is an error prone model here. No. So it's like a So what you need is A1. Do you need it or do you want it or do you this week, If you, if you breathe, you need it. If you breathe in the air to breathe, if you leave, guys, you know you want to live. You, you want you know you want to live. You know you don't wanna die. Believing doesn't mean your life, you know, saying if you're alive, you're living already, but you're not surviving. So you can want to die, you want to live. So you can say I don't want to live, you want to suicide, you know, but if you work, you want to work. We don't want to work, you know, you want to live, you know, I'm saying, so you don't want to work, you want to, you want to work. No, that's the quality there, so. This is come from so basically living does not mean your life I love doesn't mean you're living and working does not mean you want it. You know, you know, you walk into something, you know that's the objective there. So that's duality problem. So that's one inspiration every day, the ******* UK and that's what means that I'm broken. And so I want something. I need a house. End of physical health care 2014. Until four years old, my date of birth is 19th of May 2001 Namdi just out of 30 care. I'm going back to Nigeria guys. But you know, if I say I want someone to console you don't want it, you need it. You need it. You don't need it. You want it. I don't want it. I need it You know you know I want a free house under healthcare 14 days you come to to get you get. I didn't accept that the longest time. I'm gonna take the 518-2525. My life independently yes that's obviously basically just duality. So you've got the code word should, should, should. I should not listen to you. If I, if I could use something that means definitely a foundation, you know, I could do it. But, you know, I'm thinking about not doing it 'cause it's gonna give me stress in my mind, my business. I get fatigued, you know, Sir. But if it gets bad, so bad, I don't. And I want it. And I should do it and I'm living really, if I'm living I and I and I then I need to want something. I want something and I can't get it. I continue living where I am, you know, cycle of oppression, depression, and then I leave it. But you know, I wasn't doing that. I was like trying to get the best of my time. So this kind of model in my head, so. Live a want and. Uh, but so if I, if I want to live, I then would do it. So I would eat, you know, for the next day, 'cause I get hungry, get angry, get sad, you know, I know I still don't mind. And if I work, if I work, I want to, I would work. I want to work, but I don't want to work, guys. I want to live. But you know, I'm confused with living and working. Now, because I don't know that I need to breathe to live, to work first before I can stop easily, I'm not even gonna work for anyone anymore in my life. I don't give a **** again, I'm getting, I'm getting a £330 million in my bank account. So you can't do cancel and that's good enough for me. I'm not for my entire life constitution I'm not. I'm not like them, so basically never be like them If I get you know, for them, I don't really care about them really dying. But but I am real. I know my mom too. So I want to work. I would do it so I can expire and do my things I want to do So I must work. You know, I must work to get my separation goals done. This I want to do my life done. My going to came. Doesn't go to, you know, two years. Basically you get to grant 31,000. Basically the by by by the theme I'm saying to guys, I'm giving that's the the model now and you want to put another video 'cause you know, oh, the video. What time do you want to see? I'm going to try to do so. This is the other one here, but this is like a problem. So this is that good problem. This I have other all the if I'm perfect will. My nature I'm PhD, why aren't I getting the perfect support? The first I could do everything myself, you know, if I am the perfect, the best of the best, which I know I am the best of the best, which you know, that's exactly from now. So that's, that's exactly good problem. Duality of the system. And you, you reflection me to you guys. 30 money basically I'm giving you guys double the friends in my mind 'cause my intelligence work at the UK this time documents are like to go research. What else have I got now? 3 to 1 Mapping 2. OK, so there's a different son, so let's get a son a model again so I can see you guys are here doing something to do it properly. So this one's up. Basically if you make an error here to a child, this is the model you get to be the one. If you bring this one guys, it's a dangerous. So this is inverted, this inverted to something else. So this is 1 here is 333. This you got three years, you got three, you got three. Basically you got a 3A and 3B. But they continue to be there. They want so homogeneous and more spectral. And this is like a model SO1 you're breathing, you're living, you're working children automatically if anybody touches, you want to start from 3B and go to UA. So you can put it by physician by law, by law, but and by constitutional. On rights policy enforcement, you know everyone will see it's myself. You're stupid child, because of stupid people. You know you're watching a movie and somewhere else in the world, I don't give a ****. But you know where, when I live happily, you know, if I never see anybody with my on social media due to my show, anyone in my position, anyone's children in my position, I swear to God, now sue them and put down their money. You get direct to see them too. You know no 'cause you know I'm not joking with many people there. This has to stop. You know the cool wood should duality, but you know it's a must. It's a must. So this one has to break it. You could just literally start 3 beats aspiration. You can kill aspiration. What you want to do first, you know you know say oh you can't do that you know just. She said, oh, I know you can't do that. She sued him. You see them? Basically you have to say, OK, I know my rights, don't worry about it, I'm gonna sue you online. You got things like Mone claim.org. What? You. Com the original on social media basically on the Internet just take that video, put it on the muco or media platform and you get the money from the background. Basically this money came many claim.gov.uk. Or Monaco, Universal, you know, for the UK one for the 1NG1, for the Ng. So this was about the children, the Ng, the children. Children go move up. They keep moving up, they keep going. You know, no matter how old they are, we are still our children. Their children shouldn't necessarily. It doesn't matter how old I am. But you know, I'm not, I'm not, you know, I've just broken off my second operation and not my mom, you know, in English before I, I've, I've changed, I've achieved my, I didn't need to change this change. So I'm, I'm making my change where I want to live. So I'm changing what system already is. So it's my own city that you guys are going to live there. Free of charge can go your friend's house. You know, you know issues of you know you have to have your own space, your own cats and dogs, you know, especially when you turn. UH-6 or 7, so 6 or 7. Wait, when you start working children listening about children, obviously you just work start working so, so it's also not 5 because don't know last week. Just look forward because we've worked 6:00 or 7:00, but you know you don't get. Obviously you never get, you don't get to be funny video and you're 6 year old. As a policy, you're not allowed to work for me 'cause I I don't give the job. But you know, if you find someone that's working at 7, you turn 7, seven years old, you turn 7 years old. You know, then you can say, oh, my friend was six years old, want to work, but he's 6 and I'm seven. So you can work with your friend, you know, you have to be on the phone at 7, you know? System 3 to 7, so 7 years is the policy started work, but you know, it's 1616 or seven, it started work with that person. You know, it's basically there's some kind of, you know, I don't want to make it so which is a group of three, three children, so 7. So you can be 1 seven-year old and two what, 6 years old. And you can work to 15 so you turn 15 and 1615 minimum. So the minimum you are the maximum is 7 years old. You're allowing us and the 01 duality and then the 14 to busy has to be. 15 years uh, UH-14 basically I only got to. Biddy 15 years but he go 14 for 14 to 15 years old. Uh uh, you guys are I don't want you to sell it from there. So let's try this first guess for now, guys. Uh, I want you guys to be 15 and 16 to work to have like arrest weapons and my freedom. Basically everything is free. So you like, you know, if you live in a so it's a bit I'm thinking of so 14 I went to Cambridge 15I. To do you an army, so this is the army of 15, but since 16 years old so basically at 15 years old, 15 is the minimum you're allowed to work on 14 guys 15 to stop working at insurance section. So your structure basically stops your child as long as you start getting a total of like survival and stuff like that finding about. War everything is fine that you know it's fine because you know that's how the world is. You know the world is very noisy, so the noise has to be confused to you. So you could join army 15 years old, like I want to do the British Army by my situation. So 15 years or 16 years old, you're meant to be in the army, but you know, conscripted you are you are like you know you are not conscious until. 16 years old, you know, you know he's 15 years old. So basically you are. It's not an army in plus in three years platinum platinum, you know, you see in the platinum already like a three person friends. They got to go to 6 platinum taking a smallest Army unit. And then that, you know, that could be Muka TV, Muka TV, that kind of reporting, news reporting, I can go 3 * 3. Is a A6. So basically this is an example I'm giving you now. So if you join the micro TV micro media, you're going to be in the army. But you know you get the muco Lego dragon between the Lego army. So the children's army, the zygote dragon, they protect the children the the the history. So zygote children. A child you know but your child is not an an adult so we are teenagers child teenagers look at the teen Google teens muka teens. You know you guys are very good. So teens are meant to really give so busy the teens him to go to muco or zygote teens dragon because you know I don't give you my right give Dragons are what they breathe fire, but you know they. Fine, literally in the opposite direction, in the enemy's direction. And then you got the Mukuma, that Dragon's Max courage, the the masquerade. Masquerade. Not like people like small people who keep quiet. So basically can be fired and keep quiet by fire. You know, I don't want to be fire. And then you can like masquerade. Oh, I I know something about this. I can be fine. Being can't be fine. We don't know. But you know, I don't show you all my intentions yet. You know, people that don't want to expose anything. But I don't give anything NDA yet because you're not. If I should breathe muscular, what breathe masquerade and what and? No, basically anka Sir Mukul Dragons masquerade. Uh, unsolved? Is it my soul? No, no, no, no, no. Avatar. Am I the Avatar? Why? Basically your personal development framework is an avatar. So my avatar is the masquerade itself. You know, like the spirit match with the, the, the dancing express, you know, especially don't know what your aura is. You're like a private, as I said, you know, you're high-ranking or you're low ranking, but we don't know. And then we got breathing, mosquito breathing and what the last one I did Muco breathing Muko dragon. Basically you got the the the turtles and the dragon. Because basically a signal is listening. You go to turtle, you turtle watch can go somewhere and stay there for a long, long time, you know, and live there and grow with churches. Other questions, That's a Muko tattoo. So you got a dragonfly. So dragon can fly very fast, but it's also can go very slowly. So this is taking goals, but not as fast as dragon. So that's all this is just going to be very slow, very small movements. It just makes and you get the job done. It gets the job done. Can be very smart. Is it going to be the dragon? So the total is like, you know, land security, stability and rebuilding stuff, you know, if you can build stuff and then you get a turtle moving slowly if you do all of that, you know, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. Oh yes, I get it now. And I'll try to build, build, build, build double to make sure I've got everything called human so. Signal model. So signal to noise. Signal noise. Usually I get a signal. Signal to what? Build something, I do my time to my time to build it properly. So four years of my life, 24 years condition and then we get turtle. So the turtle is a rock. It's like a hot shell, you know, shell everything has to compensate how much I'm basically talking about my framework. So you go to talk to avatar. The turtle can leave. This is the first thing to basically you go to turtle on the move that stability with the people and you go to turtle media Muko turtle. So basically the Muko turtle is like, you know, if you go to in city. Difficult to this repository here. Uh no uh this li qi often even fill the image now, but you know, let me find an image now. Basically this is a this is an image of a turtle in urban access SNSIGII. There's an image there because the total is an Amazon yes, it's in there so you can be. Can pick one to give me one to two one by policy you have to do be 1 total rank and the dragon rank. You know at least one if you would 232 to one touch is got 5. But you know you can mix it up. Can you go from 2 turtles 131 one dragon to two turtles and or two dragon to 1 turtle? He has to be there for me. Very good to mix up this model and mix data and types and then we get. More people now. So that's the test of fly. Think about it now. You speak to the people, now I have to get a right to speak to someone. You're going to drop. OK, so basically there's an image of a turtles there, but you know, protocol survival. Oh, no. Oh, it's not coming out people. Oh, no. Total has move club means the spirit of evil turtles is what the turtle is what the turtle is slow. So it's not slow. It's basically subjective bound only. So the total is slow, but it's slow on purpose. It gets to the goal, it gets the job done, which is just working on proof or something to work on it, and it's slow. It gets approved down and it has stability. Oh chuckles goes to policing as soon as what? Stability is good as work done work done. That's a tier 3A. So chair 3A sponsor turtle, and chair 3B is the turtle in the robot having a system? The chair three beam is basically the chair 3A is open Open Access. A three eight and a means what A means what if. Authentic avatar you know and be for beer, you know 33 big Obi Nexus beer. That's a beautiful, I believe what because I want you to do now 'cause you know, if I don't treat it now, I I didn't want to change it. I want to change because, you know, it wasn't working for me. So that's what I'm saying. So beer and fry come and take. So the three 3 is this is the hot chair, the Obi chairs OB hot or hot? Also take take come and take a beer friend. If you want to be part of the to go to 38 and you know, basically a dual model, you know, that's three days can go from easily. I'm trying to like bridge the path because, you know, book the path if I get just mixed, if I ever make it a biological model, like, you know. If tier 3, it can go to tier 3B, but it's tier 3. There's a lot of requirements to get to Chapter 3 A to Chapter 3 B because you don't want to keep it like this. This one should be for security, but you can make it 3 ABC. You know, someone can go into anyone and gets it anything they need. So 'cause they have a path to work basically. There's no, there's only going to go back and forth basically. You can go up or down. So that's the idea. So there's no weird access model. So up, down XY access, and basically this is my XY access and this is 3 axis. Then can go from here and get a part to go to the branches to two passes and get anything they need. This is correct. This is the description model. It's corrupting the system. Basically, the two not meant to not respect me, but respect what was there already, you know, in their source. But, you know, I'm thinking of taking like some kind of going to my land 'cause I didn't have a Kingdom, I have to have land a lot in there. I have to get all my data from them and, you know, go and build my land, get my allotment to build my PhD. Start my pH D now a superior concern between that idea. So again, to sum up, children allowed to go all the way to tier 3A, tier 3, but you know, Teddy A, it's a, you know, basically a part of tier 3B already 'cause there's a dragon B dragon nuke. A dragon. That beat fire and dragon that left This is the living is not optional Living is just that, but the work is what options they can work on dragon. But you know what is 1 dragon only for them as a prior to one dragon only as a child only as a child. You know nose can prove they can't go to dragon them. So that's a policy now. So if anybody proves it not gonna get 2 Dragons. Minimum minimum of two drug is required for an adult to be if you want to breathe Dragons, the final drug of the breeding teeth, the living tear and the work or the working tier. But the big two one, that's the Dragons 123. 2-3 uh, live work and then uh. 2323 maximum can be busy. I can be all Dragons. I cannot be all Dragons in my framework there's no you have to be either Uche and then you can be dragon. You can get an MMUK. Mukul chattels. A lot of turtles are like a Ninja Turtles. So kind of like a turtle stick out, you know, like a badge. You know, basically I want to get to spoil the world, you know, you, you know, I don't even know where I'm going when I go there about to find out, but you know, I have to make the I suppose can move any way they want, you know, but they can move as incredibly slow spaces or group over. As a children, you know, you know, I don't really care, but you know if I can run come on faster, you know, you know, I guess you know universal the turtles basically got a dragon breathing the dragon dragonfly dragon living was dragon when you live they they can fly. You know they fly by where they gonna go and you go between the workers optional so. When it comes to both those fighting, that gives the family how much is defending? So first, you know, I don't want the friends around me. I want you guys to defend yourself. But now defend me, interact with my business model. I'm not able to kill my daughter and I don't even know if I want to live forever. But you know, only for this earth forever a dragonfly dragon work, dragon life dragon what basically something else Dragon fire flights for living or working life as a dragon in the world. And then dragon working basically and we just working. If you're working, you're stressed. Me, I don't work against work. I don't want to work if you're working. Let me see the film is not working. You know English, trust me 'cause indirectly. So this is work is not optional here as well. So why don't you get to do is to preserve yourself here, protect and serve yourself and serve me. If you're working for a run, you don't want to be running in a constitution working in my question, you're working there not for me, for yourself. Every person can go anywhere. You want to see Japan? I don't see Japan still. And then be the life work. It's not good, should work, but it's not optional. It's not an option. Correct Uh, try to, uh, try to what uh, basically can stay still. So start I can stay still can move an inch, I don't really care. Uh, and then you go, uh, shuttle, uh cannot fly, so this must grow. Walk this you take a walk, uh, walk very slowly, uh, and run if you want to run. Uh, I snaps nothing. Circles, you know what what Christmas tackles the personal identity, personification of a turtle. That's what the evolution of the miracle turtles are two to one for the children. They have to be authentic, representing constitution. If you guys represent continue, there's no problem representing no fragmentation, there's no problem. You know, if a child is sitting in the country, just the most perfect country in the world. You know, I, I, I love it so much. You know, the line, there's something wrong automatically. To me, this line is a red flag, typical flag. And you know, I'm not able to say that, but you say it's OK. Yeah, again, I get by doing my thing. Everything. I it's no problem. I can do everything myself. It's just it's just everyday hustle. I just don't know. I just make breakthrough one day and you know, it's simple thing, but you know, the problem was the actual building infrastructure. But you know, I'm saying to you guys, you know, how much gets to be expressing the problems there authentically, you know, ontological resolution. This is my. That's my author local revelation for my authentication covenant other revolution. You know, I want to be having friends. You know, I'm actually trying to say not not just about your breakthroughs because if your child can be sued if you want to work, you don't know it. But you can be guided to in case anything by me if you want to do OK. Thank you guys. In this video, that's Nuco zygote initiative for Muko Turtles or Muko Dragon because remember the name of that one. I'm going to end this now for the Tactical Defense Assembly and alliance. The user heterogeneous let's mix the types and homogeneous data and uniform data to uniform duality. Thank you guys. Today again is 23rd of November 2025. Thank you. And the time is now 1240 five 12:47 AM So again. I don't. Thank you. Check the process to give it a. Oh my days. The system's boss man. I love my guy. Oh my day is country so bad man. Yes, finally.
