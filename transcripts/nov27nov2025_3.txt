Yes, that's fine. Instead of getting numbly now, let me start. This is on Uh, then this must be on to. Should be double shoe stream. In Rihanna, today's date is 27. OK, so I've got recording right now. I'm going to my voice. It should work as intended. Yep. So let's do this now. OK, so before you start one more thing, please forget this. You mess up the whole thing. OK, before I continue, I'll write something down. I need to bring it down properly. Because if I don't do down properly, I would like to mess it up. So let's call it the this one here. It is a perfect circle. Perfect circle. The pie number is 2.14. This is a absolute pie. Absolute pie. It's a constant, but then it's a constant. But you know, maybe it doesn't some kind of other, a substrate that's a pie constitute. Oh, sorry, 3.14. 1415 etcetera. Then we got that, so the circumference is 2π R, 2π R, 2π R is what parameter and then we get and then we got the area of π as well. So normally the problem of the bubble theory, there's relative bubble and absolute bubble for a bubble universe. OK, guess I've done that. OK, So guys, this is very important today it's about. You got the the bubble. Basically the GS files, the GS on main, MMM for mother, A for alpha, I for Indigo, N for November. Does GS files are are the main files useful to write AT3A and T3B? Program, but you have dot G or the GSR Gotti DSR got the lab interpreters house is a polyglot. You know his translation interpreters house. These are main, the GS is a main. The GS is a user file. So basically I user files are just different files. But you know in production, so if you're in production, you're not doing T3A, you are doing sign up. You know there's a task for the. So basically if you're doing a testing or anything, you do it with the the GS I files, then you do it with the GS files, then use it to do to do. Your DSM files so the money from publicity the old managed for each other. So the manuscript files are the GSM is different from the GSI because only on the tier models tier 1:00 to 2:00 to 3:00 to 3:00 to 4:00. 23822 because I don't want to be ******* this up, but the triad model or the sparse dried. OK, So, uh, that's uh, Gussie Lang the, uh, versus uh, so this is got the public theory that we live in a bubble universe. Uh, a universe is a reference to the bubble. It's no squares anything unless you are, uh, OK. Basically this is the model here you see this positive, you go negative, positive here you get plus this chart, negative chart. So you can if you go if it if you if you go up plus one you have to have. So basically, yeah, half. Basically if you have a unit a + 1. One units for way you have to to go back. You are at a minus. You are in a universe like a negative university works you know just a half. But you have to have the unit to go to the opposite universe. So you you do a + 1. Plus one and the half down half of plus one is half. So you get half, but you're not a 0, not a zero. So you now know where nowhere and everywhere. So that's the thing. So you could you're nowhere and everywhere in the Bob universe. So what you going to do to get to universities go to half of 1/4 in 1/4. Now 1/4 has to scale up 1/4 * 4. Do times 4 * 4 for one, 4 * 1 of 1 to 4 is for and then if you do 1 * 4 it's four and then you do four of our. Usually 4 * 1 is 1 and that is not 4 for one. Now if you do opposite. So you then floor 1 and then you have to do the opposite one that's 4, flip it invariant 1 is full force is 1, and that will give you the one unit -1 it's just to do. One, uh, but that's, uh, just one conjugate. So you have to do the opposite operation. Uh, uh, so you have umm, plus UH-4 goes your nose. Plus, you know, one that should go opposite so perfect into the universe, so you go plus one. Uh, uh, just do uh, so basically you try to work it out myself. So you get a a shut up, so you get a a minus. Also I'm obviously I'm a one here in this I'm +1 'cause I'm minus plus is positive I want to go to the -1 so I do. Half of them I do half a shrink, half that's I get 1 units, 1/2 of units that's like 1/2 of 1/2 is 1/2 and then at the times by -1. One in the other direction so you can flip the second negative a half. One negative half is not enough so I have to do times -2. Consecutive 2 is what, a +1? So now I'm in. I'm not -1 sorry. I did that to get the universes. You pop, you coming, you pop this matter where you are. It's probably basically it's our universe. We're bubble theory here. This is a universe expanding 'cause we're bubbles. We never bump each other. I don't really know, but I had a we can pop to other universities can go there. 2 * 3 is 9/9. 32693 plus 3 is 6 now. So basically the basically you have a nine dimensions maximum you can search with universe. I'm not being theoretical, I'm being practical. If you look at it's just I don't like you know, so this 9 is a concert differently like a. So if you have like the pie 2-3 point hTML5 essential you can get, I can get the position some sort of arbitrary. Some kind of precise competition. Guys don't. This should never be arbitrary. You should never make this up because you know if you make up, you can lose signal. The signal are you being noise, you become the power noise. 3.1415 etcetera. If it is bad, let's just give a couple of prior to the nearest decimal. 3 point, so three. So the pie is a pie is 3.14. 59 to two different places, but. Two at the end no, if I use this console, this is a conscious term 1592. Now that part is the is the constant that spans spans the whole universe. It's just as constant, but you know it's infinitely constant. It's irrational. So you can never you can make you rational. You can. You know, depending on this kind of way, we're gonna go listen to some competition on this because I haven't done this here properly. So for example, I am the part in our world is a 3.14. So 'cause we are positive we are positron world so we go from negative. So we get if you want to translate to this we go we have to have minus first and then plus so we can get plus. So you can get plus one point 3.141. 922 you know 2 basically the three per month 453.14. 5 is just 123451592. 63 So I'm gonna just keep the 1st 123456. Six, I'm gonna **** you. The 1st is there's more places keep it and then the 65 is a wall operate on later 'cause you know, it's just like 333. So OK, 123456789 So what? 23456789 So basically I'll Kee the 1st 9 decimal places. Then keep it as what I'm observing and acting up on so I get the 9th person. That's IK principles investigative testing. Show my system can work for you. This feels guys can blame me but I don't have money for you. It was kinematics, kinematics testing. So if I want to go to another universe, say the opposite universe, that is a minus plus first and then minus 'cause it moves in that direction using the DAG, the union DAG, I have to first do it properly. So I'm at my π number is 3.14, so. 3.14 uh, one. The area, the area is completely complete the area I want to go to. So minimum I have to go to the 9 area, 9 dimensions. I send 9 dimensions to get something stable, 9 dimensions minimum and then +5 and so many maximum. To for myself to just go there only myself, but I'm thinking of you guys just to think 15 days more places 3.14. 15926753. 58912345678. 12793212345678910111213. 15 So you go 15 there's some more places and that three 2 is what? 3H. For recovery now 'cause I can do physical development like the dimension in that's what the that's all the dimensions I can access with my bubble where I am. So after use of the kind of teleporter to go to high dimension. So this is I this IK testing for me. So basically what I can do in that dimension if anything happens to me. One ascendant. So for me this is 3.4. This is bubble. So how can I go up? How can I go up? Let me put this down guys. So how can I go so I get the the constant to 15 decimal places as the unit as a standard fractions? It's a fractional unit, but it's fractional 'cause you know and you can go to the fractional unit and then you got the scalar units, the scalar just one number and 1 hole or hole, not 1/2 or something. And then you get to work more, uh, the, uh, the whole picture, the one hole. And then you get the tent units like, umm, the tent units like, you know, uh, actually like a big guy. Basically, it's gonna move. Basically, if you conversation, you can have like a 5910. So the 10 units are looking what is the tent or something. I can exist in that universe, but I can exist in the smaller scale of things and that means that something is wrong with my system. So in the worst case the 10/1 so. So how to this properly so dimensional Max now so. A 2π R. Π R 2π R 2 * π for the perimeter of stretch. So my universe that'd be times 2. To 612-331-8530 just. But guys, you know, don't worry. Just make sure you can read it. 179-586-4769. 23456789101112301415 decimal places done. That's 2π in my universal -2π will be. Same thing -2π because it's just a. A reference of 2π The same thing but negative. So radius. So my radius. What's the maximum information you can read if you can read only if I probably read? This is what, 10 units? 1 units? One unit? Can one unit bubble? How far I wanna go in that universe? So it's like an XY coded system, XYZ coding system just for parameters perimeters. So if -2π is. Most two-part is what same thing but negative π -, 2 or -2. Now Napa Π R so basically now show 50 kilometers to earth as the earth which is located. OK, so let me try to get this properly. Let me try to give it properly. Let me try to get a pharmacist on longitude, on Earth latitude. And longitude. A postal code? I'm going to do it properly guys. A postal code? Google Maps. This should be working still. No it's it's not working. I think I'll just like a it's just it's just working. Google Maps. So what can I find? Find ID 50EQ. Uh, uh, but what's my, uh, postal code? What's my latitude and what's my latitude? Latitude. And longitude. I basically can have all the information there is really important. Latitude, Latitude. Longitude. Uh, the postal code 0 Basically, yes. My latitude in this world is what? UH-51? 587573 and my latitude is what? The magnitude of my longitude is 0.0. ** basically, I've not selected rotate myself into the dimension. So what I do now is I literally try to do do that, do the computation again. So basically as I'm talking to you in this video right now, I want you guys to acknowledge this in real time. I lost my video then I don't have so much time. So my latitude is what? My latitude is what 0? My latitude is 51. Basically it really gets the same additional place 1515 so I don't lose any information, get any errors, bound through false positive errors. Epsilon states for the encoding contribution to transcend. I love this. I love this guys. I could just be evil and not keep this to myself. I'm I'm feel grumpy, but I'm Mr. Obi. Why feel grumpy no more? I got money. Thank you. So this will get people out 'cause I'm trying to it goes to 3 minutes my they will not let me record anymore. So again. I'm going to stop the video here just in case so I can do some things. So my parameter is this 51, so my luggage is 5158 seven. In the IG50EQ right now. Amount of 518754. 5187574 that's my latitude and my longitude that's like the up the Y corners is what coming from my longitude is. 00.0 8444 But you know, the most busy, the most gonna work on this side kind of unit XYZ coordination to ensure that the alignment is there and we're gonna embody the system and never break it which embodiment on my spiritual environment going back to. UH-4 umm, basically, uh, latitude. So that's just X&Y if I'm a 2D. So 'cause I'm 'cause I'm a 3D beam, I get two more dimensions. So if I ever scale it down to just two dimensions, I'll be a 2DB. So I have to have like a so it's a 2D matrix. So that's the first unit, the first one. So I have to get the healing and the ethylene and the so North East. So to go north, to go to North Pole, I have to get one 918-9662. And to go north, oh, sorry, N lane and then east lane Northeastern. Basically go like a NE you can go like a N you can basically doesn't matter your frame of reference. OK, let me just try and compute this now before I **** it up. My calculator's there. I'm I'm watching, I'm streaming right now, so I don't really care. I think I say I can save a number because I'm streaming for myself. I I'm not sure if other people really. A calculator. What's a mind I'm doing so so so so so basically, So basically I'm giving she gets a transcend, but not in the in the kind of like a quirky way. So basically. 02/02 times π. 2 * π is what a 2.14 and that is. Do times for the X coordinate. Basically for the perimeter, two-part is a three inch. So basically the two-part is just a minus plus or plus -6.2. 31853017. 123456789. 10:11, 12/13/14. 15 so it ends in A7. OK, just copy some more 'cause I don't wanna make a mistake 695-2876. Make a mistake in calculation that means I I would die. I'm thinking about myself. No, you guys now OK, so 5 and 5592 that's 32 small places and now to go position. So that's a teapot there we get the rotation then we get. 25R So my Regis is what uh, the reason I want to go to is my license latitude. Uh, so basically the Regis resort uh, uh, the egg of the bubble I want to cover. So basically I need to produce myself upwards and come downwards. So the reason I want to cover is just this room, but the area is not sort of the ridges. So oh, so the Ridge can be a unit model a unit. The radius I'm in, it's just a latitude and the latitude. So which can be the latitude and the latitude. So you can multiply think of the lasers. What's this pass? So that's the polar system. So the the basically this get the latitude, longitude. So that's another only so I can reflect myself 'cause you know that only that dimensions, the dimensions to 2 dimensions. Let me try to get it now again. Umm so I'm trying to save this properly now, do you? I don't. OK so now I get 5. Oh no no, my R is what my life is. What? So I do. I took this number. The latitude and computer over the referential point, so that's eastern, northern. If I'm going east, I'm going NE is that way. So that is upwards to NE lane is towards basically latitude are going to north, longitudes going to. Uh, uh, right, uh, but as long as it's, it's lane, so, but you know, it's easily, but you know, the east is on other side hemisphere going to Russia 'cause I'm in UK. So let me just copy this number. And type it in times times times 1 so times what so my. Sounds so good. In one dimension I am going east. If I'm using a long longitude, I'm going up up in latitude. That's my up. So my up now. I have to project upwards. I have to transcend based on my universal claim is of this that I know it works. Is after B. Basically I have to go all the way to positive. Positive 324-1234. 2869. 898. 3 so that's the first positive. So basically it's in a positive location from a latitude I have to go and this positive, this positive, positive I get a positive number, so I'm going to be positive as well. The other one, the longitude, because you know, the longitude is just oh, my longitude is a unit, OK, so 318. 79 and 50 killer, right? OK, 969-6469. 28286969. 83696969. 396-4866. +1 So I have to go to so basically after polarize myself for this kind of plane, whatever it is to transcend it means the real world. I don't really know. There's a teleporter there. I don't know, but there's no this can be in the universe. I don't know. So I have to go all this way to 324. 1-342-869-8983. Sick for and that should be places hopefully 'cause it's kind of hard to compute infinitely, but you guys should do, should do it properly, should do perfectly, guys, once or for all find for you. But you know, I'm saying that there's a positive dimension in. So I have to project myself there, uh, if I want to transcend the go to the full dimension, uh, uh, so go to So this is basically go to 4 dimension, protect myself this way. So sorry, go to the opposite universe, opposite universe. Woman from so negative, negative, negative, positive so we get like this positive, positive so now other ones like you. So we do the same thing 2π three Pi. 2π times times. The longitude. 2 pine. So 2 pine. So 2π because π is half a cent and then times longitude. The location is now 0.0. 68444. Basically this isn't gonna calculate the position. Most like get some chemical or position in Morse code. To do this, project my pin up to 30 minutes 'cause you know if it starts with elements will stop. No, two or three minutes. OK, so that's my frame of reference, but you know, I now get the actual iPod. So now I have to go to 3 point 0.21. 50231675. 22998 which basically doesn't issue. So if I'm going for my form of reference I can go to the opposite universe in my bubble. And then see my guy Namdi in this room I'm in to see him in the universe based on the I don't go to this. I don't have to go to upper dimension. I don't Basically, I don't have to go upper dimension to ever come down. I used to flip the system 'cause you have to think about it, flip how you know. See nothing. So it was a golf with the mission after either use more energy after user the half rope, the half double row, which I'll show you now. Guys, I'm just making sure that you can get this down 'cause you know my book is gonna stop. So it's a close. Really. It's really a close here. So that's one down. So that's my done. So basically for mine from my preference, numbly is other numbly. Is that 33324? 0324134286989 And then you know, but you know on a -1 he's negative system. So everything is a this world is a everything is charged by positrons. So the positrons charge everything because you know it's a negation word. So the battery is working in a positive charge is moving like a positrons, which is the opposite of negatron in this world of Nandi is in this room. He's a calm beat with him directly, but you know, if I, if he's a made of matter, matter, but he's got a bit of antimatter now he's working his computer, but now he's thinking about me and now he's thinking about how I can make my life better, not even be struggling. But that's the first thing I'm gonna say. Tsunami is still dead, but he's conscious. But he's a, his conscious will be inverted if it's if it is him. So 'cause you know the bubble here. Possessed me to go there. So stabilize the bubble in and out. So you got 1/2 row row, the half to two row which I come to, but I'll give it a swim 'cause I'm in London universe. I am like a, you know, I have to protect myself from matter, from the anti matter. I have to give myself 2:00 to 1:00. Close. So basically my coach is half every time the you reach the dimension go half like 40 to 3D go 42 dimensions, you get a dimension less you don't get get all the dimensions information. So you have it, but you're not 1/2 roll half half half scale, half half scale. Half scale, uh, half transcend, uh, just half to two. Uh, so I, I stopped basically, I have my, uh, half my resource, I have my time. I become a lesson. So if I'm a circle right now, if I'm a square, I, if I'm a, if I'm a, if I'm like a, it's my hand. So my hand for me to go up after a double over my, my lensing of my hands is to go up. So a quadruple to. For the 2 dimensions, so uh half times 1/2 is 11 uh one. So one has to get like 4 ones to go to UH-4 dimension. So that's 4 ones basically. Basically you have to go up to come down. So you go up. Sorry. So if I, if I skip this, if I maximize organization of this reality to my 3D Mart, I get 3 * 3 as 9? The 9 dimensions of access. I think I get a a a 3 + 3 six after six universities. Keep the IK 9, I kept the 9. Uh, that's the. Constant trying to reach if that concept doesn't actually devises to 8, that means that something wrong with my frame of reference and I just kind of something is going to happen. I can die in the alternatives, whatever I've been there get into my destination. So that's IK to K principle. 926 principle. So we found a go to 6 dimensions. I can do 2 * 3 is 9 to 4 dimensions I go. I have to observe of my frame of 6 dimensions to four that will be 4 dimensions or seven normally and then acting on observing minimum but you have to maximize. That's a nine dimension. I can if I want you to do myself a computer, but the two dimensions are there where I can lens are 15 cause the 15 dimensions in my reality that I can't interact with directly. I'm gonna see upright and then OK, thank you guys. I'm gonna come up to the other one. On the other one, what's the code? How this works in the four dimensional world? OK, thank you. OK. OK, Namby uh, now, uh, sports is uh, muscles broke up too. OK, so. Bubble 3. Transcending. OK, so this is now done. So if you just work guys, there's nothing should be wrong with it. Really they they should go. Nothing should go wrong with it, Mandy. Same thing. Now this is the same thing. Should know international. Stop. Let me stop this researcher now. I exported to, yeah. OK, so that's like a video. Oh no, where's my transcript?
