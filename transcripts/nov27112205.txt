OK so my thing is going now so I'm gonna do my election now so. Also basically guys, this video is not done, so we have to do it properly started. OK, so basically guy, the DSL, GSM files, the manuscript files, you can use the GS files for the GSI files, for the interpretation, for the bridge to other words. A bit of an MMUKOM for mother M for mother, M for Mike, Sorry M for Mike, M for Mike, U for Umbrella, K for Kilo, O for Oscar, that is muco undefinedO for operating. Leuco systems the spirits of good and evil that connects us all, but it's a common system for bridging. So you have to align with the polar color system. So basically, remember the half rule. So basically if you want to is if you want to go to text for two, you go up the ratio as a policy. Commission full stop policy like a pricing decoration. So if you have half of something that's one of half, make one, we have two or something when you said two or something you want to reduce it, you go half of it. So basically this is just a model of. But it's for any clothing. So 1/2 is a whole, 1/2 is a like, you know, a business system of a, the conjugate systems of transformation and rotation. Yeah, translation. 1/2 of XA half of Y 1/2 of Y half of 1 1/2 a half basically 1/2 one half half half principle to 1 to whole principle. That's the idea between all the things you do from rotation all the way from rotation to. The systems are coherence, so basically yes. So this is my model of it. It works very well, but you know you have to answer the sparse measures. In fact, sparse matrix is just the encoding of the spark machine for the quantum system. Oracle on the Oracle two public key, one private key. So you can have like say I'm a radio channel right now and I'm in a quantum radio channel and I want to call in with my phone call repository effort phonetic ish for ham, O for umbrella, N for November, E for echo. C for Charlie, A for AALAL, so that phone caller becoming polyglot too, or people across the mentions. I really want to do that though, but I don't want to via the Rifter Bridge 'cause, you know, I want to try to speak myself today. I know I can fail. But you know, just innovation. I work so I'm pretty like a, a, a bubble instead of like a Cartesian coding system. I use the polar variant 'cause, you know, this is bubble while we're living, basically everything is a bubble. The Earth is a, is around the, the, the, the, the sun is round. I don't know if it's all around. So that's we live in a bubble universe. Also, if I if we everything is basically our systems is bubble bubbles up. We bubble up in the basically our universe. Our our our bubble universe is bubble theory. Consciousness is more of a bubbles. We're all bubbles and our own reality or not will pop. Et cetera, et cetera, 21210 so I've already done this already, yes. So that's the half rule and the skill and the one rule, half to 1, you know, one to two. So basically for that we have to make sure that the translation of the four key rotations, translation, translation rotation, translation, rotation scaling. Scaling or shrinking enlargement and polarized correctly. So when you translate something and then you rotate it and you skew it rotator with then you can trace the dog with an obedience. The rotation system gag the ducks resolve in a try a conscious way. A tripartite consistent way, because you know the tripartite was is is very easy to use and ensure that system works clearly for security measures. If you want to if, if you will try to pop your bubble intention like, you know, hack your computer and steal your data, you can do that quite easily. 'Cause you know, they work on the inverse alignment of you. So everything they do, they can get the investigate. They are just basically can they can just basically can take the screen, all the inputs and flip it to get access to your system, which is a which is a bad thing because my computer blows up right now. I swear to God, I scream to her, you know, I want. For a long time, so I've basically I've tried to get two things I have like a private key and two public keys, two public keys, but one one for one for like connected to them and another property gets hidden. So that basically the jump of the bubble keys are there. So they're also very figures a circle bubble key and that's. Universe, uh, my mobile universe, uh, my other book, the X universe. So basically the, I shut my eyes, I asked my, uh, other public key and then still links to that our private key, but they're homogeneous kids. They work together. OK, give me the same data. But you know after switch contest switch between the two keys using my if then else policy. So if I'm using key A or key one or key A and key B. I'm using key, I'm not using key B. So basically, are you going to use key Ki? Stick with K until the session closes. So basically, let's say yes, I set up key A, but you do go yes, yes, yes. You just say yes to our channel. I set up my key A. My key will start talking and they they can relate what they want to say to me, which is public key. The consistency is the code. So when you have the consistent keys there and then I just did it. I don't tell them about KB, why it is my computer, but you know. There's a big problem with all of this really because the public is in my system, we can find it anyway, just we don't just get basically can try to find my roots repository and try to just acd get whatever the null is, the nail is it and just get it. I'm not scared of it. I'm just like really wondering about my computer 'cause only when I have so this. The circle key I keep it on the eye so they can get that key. If they try to bubble up the key will prevent them. Uh, uh, uh, I'm looking to, can give him the roots, but you know, they can, they cannot know what that is because you know that people lock them down. But it's like a hard look. It's like a dimensional lock 'cause, you know, it doesn't look to our dimension, it looks other dimensions like a lock file, like a, a Python or lock file or you lock the YAML. You know, look for us just look our octopus lock system down without any social for temporary use of like a like a someone's version. So the problem, the problem is basically with this particular just it's like a if I have one key and I have the other key, I have to hide it safely. Uh, uh, but don't know uh, put in accordingly. I don't uh. So what I have to do is create a session in the direction I am for the terminal with W for Wink, S for Sarah, Y for Yankee, S for Sarah does the repository. So it's good to repository WSYS. You can get the keys, get one key. To one key to keep close at all times until you continue the session. So they rotate, rotate. So when I use one key, I close one key. I close one key based on polarity. So if I miss this key, I'm looking at this key. If I look at this key, I'm using this key that is loaded up if I if I don't watch it, if I. I switch the rocky and that all the key is loaded up. It's dynamic loaded for public keys, but you know I can only look at one key at a time because if I ever look at 2 therefore. Can do anything more, so that's the first thing I'm gonna do. So I have two public keys and one priority. So the product key is just for metadata for me, my computer, if I want to isolate the system. Now the product key does the same thing. Can do the same thing, but just one key. One key Sir the 2/1 or 1/2 mapping. So basically can have two private keys are one public key depending on the networking topology set. But I'm trying to random polarity. So if I look at the if I'm using the the B key and the the B key. Something happens to be key, my system runs out and the shuts down. I can crash down the be key and not get this without releasing information cause the big key is start to session already in the consensus from in the one using my height, my my my my private key which I'm using. Which was to do so if my computer breaks right now, I I suppose it's a break, but you know, I'm doing it for science, a lot of science. OK, so, so basically dimension. So I'm observing the stage of the world right now. I'm sure to do it properly. Oh, so that's also basically you can get 2 to one mapping on one to two, we can resolve the gag. So if I ever try to do it properly, I can be polarized anyway, so I can get 2 pairs of two pairs of two keys. So 4 pairs basically after one facing the the. The the the conjugate of plus negative, so the further out people that are more further out of the dimension domain, but that's map to the center key. Basically you get 4 keys, 4 private keys for each dimension. A total of 16 keys because you get really a minimum of 16 public keys and four power keys in this system because you know, you don't know we're going to be polarized to under something to if you know, you get no point of a, you know, you don't know the address you're going to go to. So it's like, you know, it's like security in mind. The order still I will try to get two public keys and the further two public keys one private key for any access minus, minus, minus, plus, plus, minus and plus plus. OK, so based on where you are, your frame of reference in the bubble field because you know you are working about. So how this works again, it's based on latitude, longitude. So I'm just talking to myself right now. So I have to literally just get punching statically or dynamic IP address. Based on the job, the topology model. So I can literally watch this. OK, I can literally create a try to create a 3D system where I basically I'm in a 3D World right now, but I can polarize myself up. Dementia look up, uh, basically bipolar myself, I look, I, I try to access more dementia that I actually am so I look at 123 but. Look up, I can listen. I can't I can't look up without scaling the magnet of information. So for example, if I say my I'm learning my half, basically this information is there in the center. So basically I'm busy. We're using the only can measure all of our bubble universe, but there's no universe here that's the center. That's more information, but we can't lens it. We can't see all of it because you know, it's too much and and you know, we just get a glimpse of it, you know, so we can try to look at the Bob Universe 4 for this model so we can work it. Otherwise look at two different. D tensor our system so we can create a fully dental a 5D or 60, it doesn't really matter. But you know, I'm gonna start the 41. So the goal is this, you learn the 41 or the 2D1 the 4D. So basically get 4 * 4 the 4D times 44 * 4 plus you know what I do? So you get I'm trying to work it out. So you get a 4 * 4 * 4 * 4. So you get 4 + 4 + 4 + 4. Oh, that's a 16 times. Tons. Oh, no, you cannot stop Umm Rukh Khan stop. OK, uh, let me just, uh, try to uh, uh, find my recording, uh, uh, open a file location. OK, so it stopped working. So 'cause I'm gonna stop abruptly, uh, so let me stop recording abruptly too, before I make a mistake. Uh, Yup. There we go Let me just try to upload this video now. Guys, I should have to do it. Let me just stop this now. OK, so basically Microsoft, just stop this one. Let me just try to stop this one now. By literally uploading the wrong one. Oh, it is. I don't know anything about. Uh, this one here uh, this one I uploaded right now this is a 5556 uh, this is 55191. So this one I need this one. I OK this one I can I can change. Is this a is this the Tiktok 1 Tiktok? No, this is gonna be a Tiktok 1 here. OK, so that's uploading there, so let me just stop the other one here. Let me just see this transcript now before I lose this transcript 'cause it's I know it's going on still. OK, let me just stop.

OK so my thing is going now so I'm gonna do my election now so. Also basically guys, this video is not done, so we have to do it properly started. OK, so basically guy, the DSL, GSM files, the manuscript files, you can use the GS files for the GSI files, for the interpretation, for the bridge to other words. A bit of an MMUKOM for mother M for mother, M for Mike, Sorry M for Mike, M for Mike, U for Umbrella, K for Kilo, O for Oscar, that is muco undefinedO for operating.

C for Charlie, A for AALAL, so that phone caller becoming polyglot too, or people across the mentions. I really want to do that though, but I don't want to via the Rifter Bridge 'cause, you know, I want to try to speak myself today. I know I can fail. But you know, just innovation.
