Move this computer. Send.If it's easier, have it this one is not recording I I do not close this one. I can just try this one on OK no, this summer this is his ten. She would record a long time, but I don't trust anything so. 3 minutes and my clock out here should rain. OK so basically I've got one. I want to do it. OK guys this video is very important for me. It's basically a video of the willing to do all my life. You know, the pressure of my speech the way I am this way. I've never made a video by I was in that stuff, but basically this video, I must follow it very well. Because so the whole home, delicious philosophy. Heart all and soul 2 connections. My heart and soul 2 connections to world. OK, basically you said ontology, nature and nature of being. Are you asking how does intelligence what things are take the SpongeBob, what we can know about them? Uh, because Beijing films such as the system that's observed advice to find reaction self. Yes, yes, this is like a clothing prompt. So basically, what's ontology? Ontology, guys, is my research instant? Especially what's the whole internal white organisms exist, are placed in the universe, how we know ourselves, how we perceive ourselves. Ontology for me is very. At a quarter, maybe just who I am. My persona Heart to Collections is 1 of what I call polarity and my heart, my person, my, my heart, myself, my good heart and my evil heart. It can be good to myself. I can be evil to myself. But that's like, do I have a hot, you know, my heart is just good at you depending on how how I'm behaving, how I'm feeling. When I'm hungry, sad, angry, that's just that. Could be nature. That'll be nature. The the natural things that happen in the world that affects that cause and effect, duality and nurture. My upbringing, my trauma, my environment, you know? This video is because ontology is the core of this entire framework. Anthology is just not what things are. It's for me, it's never what things are. It's how things are. How are they like that 'cause you know, if you think about yourself, you are, you know what your skin is. OK, basically let me give you a sample. I'm asking so you look at Apple, a red apple. They would rather put is very juicy. Now you take a bite out of that and looks very juicy. It's basically an umbrella. It's red, it's shiny. It fell from a tree, it falls from a fall. You pick it from a tree, you pick the red apple, nothing ticket. And then you look at it. Oh so red. It's so juicy. They're picking up and you bite it and you say, Oh yes, it's the apple. I'm putting the apple. It's a very juicy taste, like I expect like an apple. Then you take a a goose French apple, but it's green apple. So you take this apple and then you bite on this apple. When you buy this apple, it's not really as appalling as I'll taste it 'cause, you know, my focus is me biting apple. I says apple is not. Happily, it's not juicy, it's not. What means what I mean spectrum apple. Now are these both apples? You know, yes, you will say that, but you know my nutrical say yes, but you know I'm autistic. I'll say no, no, no. It's a few different things. Now, while I was saying all you know is 'cause it's a green apple. And this is a red apple. But does we don't know the term apples? Who gave that thing? So we can apple is just a word in English. We got like a other words we can give it based on our anthology. The nature of our being but authority is just more about to me about how we work, how we build, how we process information, our real world, how we how we work, how we went, how we, why, how we. Where, how we, when and that's more about that's architecture as infrastructure. You know, it's about anthology, but what's why are good questions to ask if we don't give you the bigger picture on structure of a syntax? But we we can know about apple. So now you get. So basically now you say, OK, I'm gonna try to get this apple red apple, but give it what classifieds an apple yet. But both apples say yes, yes. Now this is not apples. The ground trees, they have the same process go through the place of life and that the goal is to start the seat. But then you get a tomato. A tomato is a fruit. Yes, yes. And apples are fruits, but tomatoes, what a vegetable. So it it's like to be on the ground, it grows in ground and doesn't go too high. But it's also fruit. So it it's a fruit and an apple. It's a fruit. So it can be in apple clothes and in the fruits Vegas and veg fruits and vegetable clothes. But it's it's different. It's nature is different. It's like, you know, if I wanted to ever. Create an apple from scratch. I have to go. You know, from scratch, but I haven't known I have to get a seed. But the seed has what we don't know what seeds fully made-up of genetics code, protons, you know, but if they capture the full information of what a seed is, so we can get an apple tree. But, you know, that information is so sports and so dynamic, it has to be like, you know, a computationally infeasible for any computation today. But also I'm saying to me, I'm saying that the nature of anthology is the nature of reality. But you know, it's important to of relative. So it's not just fully subjective, it's just more interruptive based on how we are afraid of because I don't know that the word in French, German, apple. But you know, there are other ways to consider this an apple. So basically a limited lens view, undertaker of the subjection. And we have fragmented ecosystems such as countries that change meaning all the time. New Divergent. But you know, that's what ontology means to me. Basically my sense is when I eat an apple, it's an apple. Fourteen to seven. I get basically the seven senses that I have. Seven, 7 + 7 is what, 14? A first and sight, taste, touch. Hearing another crunch of the apple or the touch of the roundness, this, uh, the sight, uh, what it looks like, uh, the, the, the sides, uh, smell, sights, taste, touch, scent and. US12345 senses and then my, my, my perception of that sense of The Sixth Sense, you know, open sense and the 7th really my interpretation of that is so basically if I see the apple, red apple, oh, it's a red apple and this is an apple. Oh, it's about red. This one's green and this is red, but they are the same thing, so. I didn't say, OK, now I taste the green apple. Now the green apple I tasted, but you know, it says juicy, so I'll see. This is not an apple or a full apple, just a little variation of it 'cause then that little difference means, oh, it's not the same apple, it's not the same, you know, 'cause you know, if they feel that taste, that if I should have taste basically. 7 * 7 If I any any division in information I I take in from my senses gives me a full sense of security of that thing 'cause that is different automatically, which is why I don't class the green apple as an apple in the red apple. I know they are apples. But they're not opposed to me in the same thing and the word apples too rated to describe the full experience I'm experiencing. For me, this one means we knew divergent because you know if I start taking up Also for busy, 7 * 7 is 49. Basically 7 union 7 is 9 + 4 nine ten 11/12/13. 13 and then 4564563 senses for. Basically my sense is again 63 dimensions of process 'cause you know the minimum one is 7 + 7, 'cause you know 7 intake and seven relay. So for the five senses, the one I experienced the food for the inverse kilometer sensors. Things that I can act on, I can get 14. 14 and the and the and the cases like A-77 senses. But you know, but you know, 7 + 7 is 1419 two to 69. So we get 69 three dimensions for processing this kind of information. But you know, that is composing so much ways so much ways that that that it's like a accountable. It doesn't really mean that it's. Yeah, one class. It's a static system. It's like, you know, if at least one Apple and then I buy a corner, it doesn't account for all the variations in the world, you know, 'cause you know, it's not static. It doesn't feel rigid in the my in my view, it feels like something is. Experiences of off of queue. OK, next question. So this house basically the next one, this one gonna also epistemology. Now if anthology is what, why no epistemology is what? Yes, how I know about the, but you know, that's more of a classification from don't go to that now let's go to other one. Don't know for the magic legend. So see, I can only taste apples in my dimensions. I'm a 3D being. 'Cause I'm basically I'm a 40 bean, but I know I'm 3D World, so the I couldn't just up as a mower. So I get a three dimensions to taste an apple or fruit or orange like, you know, some kind of fruit less, you know. And then my senses are and then I mean 3 doors. So 3 + 3 is the minimum dimensions you can have in. Three to three ratio 323 means 3 + 3 = 6 six dimensions. Now this kind of proof screen 3. 3 * 3 equals nine. 9 + 6 or 15 no 15 is what not union of it. Sorry is it a British unit? This is union of the five. Nine is 15 so get 15 dimensions. I can be in my relative but only taking my XYZ through my senses. My senses. But you know I can interact with up to 15 dimensions phenomenologically. Cause if I close my eyes, my consciousness extinct. 3 matter. So there are 15 dimensions here in the world. My world student. But you know, I don't need to observe, I don't need to use them. I don't know how to access them. The access is limited because I I don't know if you can try to try to go to meditation state. Uh, Malaysia's street, uh, but you know, down after some of it, I took it seriously. I can try to actual project. Try to go for my will go far and my mom to travel across the plains. But you know, only bound to 15 dimensions 'cause my world is 3D, about a 3D sensory 'cause I see X up to down, you know? You know, 'cause I'm a yes, it's done. Should be done.bout to this person show phenomenological meaning. Uh, OK, lah, uh, if you want to talk, this is just so, uh, the nature of knowing, uh, know yourself, but the nature of knowing all the things, uh, which is phenomenological, uh, lens protocol. So for my also, can I can access this the other 15 dimensions because they are there for me to access, but I don't know how to access them. Because I am already in the framework of this system, What things are related to epistemology? The nature of knowing. OK have my things stopped or no? OK, The nature of knowing epistemology is the same thing. It's just, you know, how do I know what I know? I do know what I know. Sometimes if you can class them, classify them multiple times, so I guess. I could do one way to say 15 dimensions minimum for like access. I can't if I want to access it and then see 3 dimensions for a sensory processing minimum because you know, I've been double that and that's the minimum sensor. So so how do I? How do I know what how do I know about them so I can famous courses? Basically doing stuff can be done in many ways, but you can see a couple of how do I know how am I sure how am I show. I know what I know which kind of personal, so you know it's a valid information stream. So I can give you one more so you can get most code. Now most code is like repeating patterns, you know, but it's universal patterns. So if I, if I look at my ref library and I have most code, I I can accumulate. Sometimes we lane it's it's, it's, it's kind of a incise to me, but you know, we have some sensory protocol that kind of interact with no intercom, but you don't really know to show it is or it is not there. Uh, because I'm saying that you know, it's not just like, you know, I know, I know I can, I can check, I know what I know. Because it's the force into some. A classification he reached clarification, or lack of lack thereof, of it, of a structure of some kind of data stream that sparse. And you know, can switch, you know, it doesn't break myself. And I can classify, 'cause it's part of this music. And more than the discount shouldn't be any form of thought because not the apple or the tomato. Dilemma. What's your future like? The first element or the carrots of the? Basically all vegetables are are fruits anyway, but they grow them on the on the ground. The yam is a fruit, upon the yam is a fruit. Yes, so the person is looking on annoying stuff, getting more insight, you know, but you know, you can use really a lot of relay to classify a lot of verb now. So the verb now actors like that, the verb now of this apple red, apple, red apple. A red tomato. Buddy stomachs are classified as they. They just things like anchor to that thing. No I can change the term red to green apple. Or or or yeah, orange character, you know orange character. But it's like the confusion of fruit and veg. In my world view, fruit and veg 'cause you know they are, they are the same thing but more just more healthy. An easy to grind and easy to process. You can go from three if you give him the car from where you want to eat the car from the ground naturally. But they aren't, they're healthy. You dimension d -, 9. Proved authority from basically. A a new definition for topology. OK, yes, yes, my this is based on me, my news. Basically I am I'm a specialist. I believe I'm ash predicted from this place. From this world, so I believe I was a particular down was because you know, this mythology, I was going to see those. I was in the 40 world when I was born, said we want to give Namdi a chance to be, to be in a 3D World. But you know, that's how to admit to you guys, 'cause you know, I, I felt targeted by my new divergent people that anchored the, he told me my new devices. But I I believe I was down projected from my plane of business for one reason and one reason in order to make a change to the world to anchor my purpose to do something before I join my meet my for this partial space. So my 40 world is like 4 * 4. Four 4 * 4 Sixteen 4 + 4 is 16. In 36. 6 + 6 is 12. 34550 dementia so basically I50 dimensions, but I'm this what I'm 36, but you know, when I was born, I, I, I have a thing basically I was in the hospital and I was able to see everything in the walls, outside the walls, you know, 'cause I came at mom's house in my mum was like a fully born and I think the process all the. Information around me, I knew where the breath let me think, but you know, I said to let go 'cause I didn't really know why, but I didn't quit on it. So I can see what people normally the distance they were in the room. I knew what was going on, but it wasn't me really. Definitions of my head. It wasn't me because of it was making sense of. So that meant that someone was process formation itself. People this, this went to me. This people post information. I can, I can. I was like a baby as a child. I was like observing information indirectly into my consciousness. I was like, oh, why this? And you know what? I wanted to turn off my eyes and not see. I could have done that. What I want to just hear this person's voice. You know, but you know, one of my time is running out. So it's like my time was like I wasn't dilated. It was like a time was becoming more linear, more, less linear, more like I was spending everything on everything is once. But I, I, I just came back to my mom and everything just collapsed for me, 'cause I just wanted to collapse, 'cause I wanted to just. Ice and sea was there myself and everything was easy to understand 'cause, you know, it was more mature with my rhythm, my beats and it was more of formal ontology. So basically the everything dissipated, especially all the signals, which are called signals became noise. What's up the window ontological? I can still access the signals, the phenomenal signals if I want to, but I don't really want to do that for you guys. Now the Frank Stein Jacko problem. Now oh is the down? No no, let me just check this. This should be done. No, It's oh, oh, it's stopped, is it? OK, no, let me just keep on quickly try to the Frankenstein Jekyll problem. So basically use metaphors. Are you trying to argue about Western or design? So basically. The. I don't know. I'm basically they are, they are, they are not fragmented. Usually people are not building ontological cells. You know, they just why you have authority systems. You know, if you polarize yourself through the service, you know, being fragmented yourself. So this is you're the heart of the system. You know, in my framework ontology, you're the heart and soul. If you're writing a code, you are writing for yourself. You know first. You know. But people are stressed. Well, stressed people are working hard. People are looking for proof. You look for money, but not thinking about how this matters in the long run. Especially when it crashes. And also they write code that is a reflection of this spirit and the soul, you know, whether it's like a a business or bank or, you know, the, the rights that don't really align with their vision because the. Me. This is for corruption. It's not about corruption or human indignity, lack of thereof. No, it's about authentic analysis of yourself, your soul. You know who? What are you? Who I am for me. I was asked this question. Who am I? What am I still in here? Why am I? Why am I talk enough? Me. What am I talking about? You know? It's like a it's like, why? Why am I? Why would even bother working anymore? It's even about the work in the morning. It's like it's for me. I don't wanna look at something in the world around me. I can't fully classify it. I can, I am touching my skin right now, but I can't. I can't my my sense of touching my fingers. Or like mine is unfortunate my head. I can't really understand why this is coherent. It's it's like I don't I don't interpret it as a full stream of information like words. By interpreters in the mining sense, it's like a kind of like weird how I troubles 'cause I feel like my forehead is quite a but it's funny. I need this one used to be sweaty, but it's sweating really, but the wheel is not really. Good. It's like, you know, it's back in circulation. It's like a drag oil. I smell it. It smells, smells bad, but it doesn't align with my vision of what feeling a surface of my my head or my head feel like, you know, I am seeing my skin is soft. But I don't know what I should be that way. Graphics, you know, So what seems to this is like, you know, you know, when I'm building for myself, should I build, should I build someone else ontologically or should I be for myself first, my heart, myself, my spirit, or should just accept this, you know, 'cause I'm, I'm black right now if I die. Those cells are gone into, but you know, I think it's not me that did it. It's kind of unless it's proof. So this like I'm doing basically the question here is should we if we could do it? Should we if, if I should, if I can do it or if I can't do something that I consider immoral? It's almost as a framework of anthology. And vice versa, should I, you know, should I 'cause you know, if, if they think you are hostile, they will actually end you. But there's no consensus to that system because there are there. Consensus is a a, it's a again, shows. And other ontological nature Antaglia 5 as part of the she, she said. I don't believe in defense. It's past offensive. At least I saw photos I guess I don't know. OK, so spouse off and so obviously sparse offense is a sparse difference is basically when you defend something, you defend it via phenomenology and ontology. But defense is not a rigid, I mean attack is not rigid. So we can find. Losing your defense ultra attack so 10 about anthology initial self. It's also attacks me. I defend myself once find a way to defend myself. They find another way to attack you. You that defend will be useless. Like I used to defensively be something that's a new or a new stuff attacking or like, you know, if I punch someone, if I punch someone, they punch me back, especially if I pinch someone, sorry, pinch, pinch. If I pinch someone, they pinch me back. But if I punch someone, they punch me, they punch me twice as hard. Continue they understand that pinching is a is just a simple thing you can get over there. But you know, if if I if I punch someone once, they can punch twice as Hawking they they can, they can the the consensus broken. The first one is a pinch. It's going to punch the third one pinch point first. We covered first day of the month. June, July basically the first is like, you know, the the the the the ontological response before on a fail safe collapse, you know. A proactive surety rather than an exhibition now constitutional. Uh, uh, computing and applying authority. Uh, so apply your service. Basically, my, my life has been on logical. I've been looking at myself all the time since 9, since born. Never division, you know what's on my who I am, what can I, what I know, my persona, everything about me 'cause you know, if I was born from an from a zygote, because I go as well. I was born as a zygote. So when I was born, there was a, you know, us growing in the room. So but you know, there was like me and the dog is like a the male and Spanish. Male sperm fertilize in the egg and the female sperm, but you know, this is like a model zygote model 'cause you know, thinking about the models also, if I'm, if I'm a man, if a man, if I'm a young boy, then why do I have autism? A lot of people don't don't listen. What's confusion on my new division? What makes me new or flexible? But you know, my, my, especially my hypothesis is looking. I got fertilized, but it's not my, it's not my. I'm not, I'm not a problem. It's not my, it's not my dad's side. It's my mom's side. His mum's eggs was something. Wrong, but my dad actually corrected and I became more or bipolar, autism, ADHD as well. Just learn severity because there was some kind of an misaligned with intent of the system between the gamut. But you know, the government I didn't have obviously I, I was basically for me, I'm I'm reflecting on myself because I used to observe the stream of consciousness in the real time. I was going to see stuff on like a navigate. I was basically I was, I was basically. Person relating I just popped into reality. If you don't believe me, when I go fertilizer, it's like pop pop and then there's a silence 1D point Oh and then 1D point you come grew, grew, grew, grew. I started seeing a one day point and that and then I and then zoomed out and then I that's even one point then basically pop and you just. You know, uh, X-ray, you know, and then. You know, was it like a light sleep? It's mostly and then I said, oh, I mean, actually let me go ahead. But you know, that's my mind growing my feet is busy for me. This represents my the the the zygote problem, 'cause you know, why do we think probably just like a a little sure that the minister's past. Oh, no, no. OK, then close. Uh, designers, you get me to a meeting. You get me a meeting. It's not even about a game's meeting. It's a if something's new, it can look, it can look itself in that framework of the 3D World. It's just in, but not. It wasn't like. It wasn't like a well, obviously I was pretty sure so it was more of three dwarfs was there. But I came in there from the 4D world reality 'cause you know, I popped into the three world, so I wasn't. So that was like some kind of wave, some kind of sparsity dimension that put me into this reality by grew as a fetus. I could observe my surroundings literally. I can go to go out to people's minds and see stuff and go further in time, you know, as far as my questions can stretch. You know, but I was being pushed up backwards, you know, bootstrap in a way that was like, you know, trying to make me more human. I mean like a making more this kind of person. So I act like a go back in time, 'cause, you know, trying to think back in time and we thought talk back in time. I can access things that happened in the past like. Breakthroughs or work? People's history of work. But you know, people don't believe me, so I don't prefer it. Yes, but that's why I call the encoding of the zygote problem. Because, you know, I'm thinking of if I have an ear system 'cause this is given to ear system to act on a observer, but a system's relatively computational. No matter how yeah, she seems, you know, you can use Chrome logic, you know, it's budget rules. But you know, if you give the AI full consensus to build its own utopia, what would that look like? What what that look like, You know, to me, that's what I mean. You know, if there's a good perfect, what is what is the competition? Of the colors formally so you know if you give it freedom to use all the web interfaces at all. Why say this is because for me, if I can talk to you my own utopian and stuff right now and have a bubble around me my from my bubble 3 so I can never pop in a no matter if I die 'cause my blood keeps growing and growing and growing and then coming in brewery. Go to 1 to basically. Pronto threes pregnancy uh 3 or 4. To 5 or 6 is another pregnancy of the embryo UH-6 or UH-6 UH. 678728 is where you can get one. We can get someone get both 7 'cause they're very good. Well, but in this one, my cycle of it. So if you go to the embryo system. A lot of them the money desk is 1. The darkness one displays one disposal noise signal to noise coherence 'cause you know the signal was becoming noise and the noise could signal and becoming more aware of my going to places and using my mind. This is trying to go. I was thinking a lot of things, just not embryo. But it's the kind of more try to split to me, I'm not a problem means my mom's ex this room 'cause I'm the male, I'm a man. If I ever tell a woman, I'll tell you my dad, there's a room something wrong with his males and I became autistic and your divergent. But you know. But it's not the woman I'm missing. I'm not autistic, I'm not different. Let me see. I'm not flexible 'cause I don't have to tell me your divergent. So this is wrong with me, but it's something up with the process of this thing perception I had. The Academy with as a child, because I don't know people don't have this kind of experiences bootstrap their own consciousness. They're not aware of the metastate being born, which is why I'm really interested in this 4D sporty team one or four 3D recognition. Let me see what. Just now, yes, it's 5. Uh, fine. Uh, sure. OK, UH-5. Wait a second. Could you show me? OK? Thank you. OK, 'cause this one or computer. Oh, oh, this is this one. Stop. Oh, this is a stop. This now 03 minutes. It's not even done. Uh, uh, UH-5 uh oh. Wait. Five. OK, let me still go here. Uh, OK, sure. OK, OK. Basically 5, uh, five, uh, condition, uh, uh, competition condition as applied to authority as your, uh, proof of the authority is just flexible. Uh, is it both? It's philosophical because, you know, we have to look at each of being. To address any role apartments, but philosophy is just not really. Good. Obviously I love Greek mythology, but you don't have a lot of problems, you know, but you know, all of her problems are not taken into account 'cause you know, it seems dense. Dense. I look like the, the, the Dragons, you know, 3 Dragons, you know, those are like a epistemological questions, that of nature, nurture being real. And I found a lot of solutions in them, you know, like, you know, the mermaid. Medusa and other solution. This is anthological problems already. OK, you know you can see you and if you touch the snake you tend to snake you snake you just snake. You turn to stand sand stand to stand a stone sandstone and you consider a statue. Why is a gaze? Why is a Medusa's gaze? Unique. And why? Why does it? Why does her beauty? How is it? What what what is a what are the gays? Only her guess 'cause you know, she's, she's powerful. But I guess turn a man to stone. But to turn men to stone? What's the backlog? Why? Why does she have the power? What does that mean for women later today? You know, women in seas who have Duggars. Is there, is there a real world example of the reflection of the anthology to, you know, of this case in the world of a man? Man gazing, A10 woman gazing. Making a man dead. These are called. What do you call it? Death, you know they call the the something model the something model. But the skin of women can kill people send me to tell this woman dangerous. But they're beautiful with a danger. They do it in an elegant way, like the man, the serial killers. But they are sending fit house, which I love for me to tell us more 'cause they're more aligned with my, my view on the on the on women's nature. And the nature duality. OK, Part Part 1 foundation condition which routine being and becoming in your framework. OK being is is can be survival or living, but being doesn't serve a purpose. It can be a purpose. You know it can be alive. But you don't have a goal, a goal in mind. It's like, you know, if anybody can over sensitive centuries or sensitive stuff, you know, you can't observe the reality, your reality, you're just being. But you get things done whether you do it on purpose or not, you know, but you know, you're like a Alzheimer's or something like that. You don't, you don't fully comprehend your reality. Then you are be in you are in a state of a life and you're a being in that note becoming now becoming is. You have full sensory preservation and you can act on your own intent and your own accord. You know you don't need anybody holding your hands. You know, it's more of you finding trying to navigate yourself and not be. Misled by someone so being and becoming two different things. You calculate a new divergent dimensional or DDD. What is dimensional ontology not mathematically what dimension is being in? Oh yes, yes, basically my, basically my basically, I mean my basically basically my human decision. So you get a 14 to 14 metrics here. So fully transporting is what 14 * 14 or 14 * 1414 * 14 is what? Also 14 * 14 is 196. No 14 + 14 is 28. 28 and that's 28. That's like one of his 89101112. 910-1112 2122O2244 dimensions, for instance, it's like a so you have like a basically I believe I'm from I have to mention 14 minimum because of this thing. I said a 40 burner structure to the 40 dimension, yes. So basically if you want this is a tensor, the 40 dimension is a tensor. Get 2 sets, you get 2 pairs of matrices, the XYZ pair XYZ, XYZ by three by three. So basically get 3 you get a four dimensional 31231. OK, let me try. 1123123. 123123. Almost basically get a a matrix of a dimension for 4D dimension gets a dimension of 1234 is basically get the dimension of. Basically get a 4D matrix. Uh, which is a full by full matrix uh uh uh uh one uh, which is a 4 by 4. You know 312341234. Oh NI Yi GE 16 ah total dimensions you can access a bit which is just numbers 123 and it's which mean extra dimension, Y dimension and Z dimensions, where 3 is just the start. The maximum number can get almost since you this dimensions 4 * 4 and 60 dimensions. Uh, maximum, but it's not 'cause you know, the, the nature of this position for you. Typical authority is the measures mean anthology. The measures means there's partial plane I am in and how my, my, my, my, my. My, my sense is right now in that common frame can be amplified to focus on that actually some kind of thing I can act on and without reasonable power. That's, you know, without question paradox in the whole universe, you know, 'cause if I have a progress means that I'm not going to be in animation and I'm lost. So this they've come crazy. Someone takes on my body like a man hike, you know, but you know, tragedy for that just means the if I see something, can I accident? Am I allowed to accent, you know, that kind of epistemological question. Seen doing a being a conduit of that, but you know, the mission actors have to ensure the whole dimensions don't align with their own objective. Why Beijing specifically? Occupation or basically vision allows competition. Basically get a Beijing intelligence infrastructure. Beijing is allows us to computer if you have like some kind of dimension. I want to access a dimension with the dimension. My dimension has a dimension 7 * 7 which is 3 dimensions. That's my dimension of this 3 by 3 is what 3 * 3 is 9. I have to mention 15 dimensions access at a time in parallel, but you know at the time in parallel I can I can be in one dimension and jump to the dimension. So it allows me to do that probabilistically without causing a product. Can you give a comment about how Obi housing claim difference in UK? Yes, ontological Bayesian infrastructure. Basically it's like. And the, the, the economy is basically I'm thinking of the system of the ontological vision system because they are Beijing, they are, they work on probability. So if I don't. Let's see like a try that consensus processing. So the try it's gonna try that trying to exercise with consensus model. If I don't do something once I'm not wrong, I'm just I'm a mistake. It's a mistake if I didn't if I didn't continue then statement, then I continue to not do those things I probably forgot. Now, yeah, this way we just pick it up and say, Oh yes, don't know you've done it, I've done this for you. They can get on your day and I don't have to worry about tomorrow, 'cause he's tomorrow, but we can do this name 'cause he's tomorrow. They wouldn't give us how three times, you know, we'll fix the problem 'cause intelligence enough to think about my info from my surrounding 'cause it's a dirty bin. I put the bin out dirty. I put it like a rubbish bin. I put the the my my bin but my my my my cocoa bulb or my monster bottle in the bin. Vice versa honey it's like a dirty bottle and the Berry bottle. Just put it wrong and soon can collect it. OK. Her name is gone. Let me try to correct his mistake 'cause you know, that's what I'm saying to do so, Mr. 'cause you know, if I call no question, you come back, I will be oh, do some more work 'cause you know, it's about showing that the system like, you know, for me, I have a bed here, but it's very dirty, so this bird can be tired when I need to. 2:00 to 1:00 to 1:00 to warm up in. But you know, you have to assure that I'm ready to sleep, you know, in case I want to use the bed so you can, I can put away a better way 'cause I like put better things to put themselves away 'cause you know they you don't need it. You need more space for your day. For example, if I have something to go to bed and the bed, I put away 2 to one. Rapping 2 to one just means 2 inputs, 2 inputs, 2 inputs, A&BANB going to and then that becomes a A1 output. So this is 1 mapping. So data is Apple data coding. Then it's a functional method and then that or that one that one inputs. If you get one input, I get 2 outputs out. Like it's a one to one ratio between the two and start with a 11221 on several one. 212-2112. You know, Christian, if I do something once, obviously if I if I have a function that data once again two outputs those type of map to the factors, two factors and those two functions will be passed out of the next two functions and come one apart. But that's more sustainable probability measurement of using if then if then get to the policy. And if then else if then if A foundational and inspirational goals can only try to get this done. Uh, 40 minutes. OK, I go now. Uh, can you give a yes, yes, uh, you could, uh, basically pay compressor. Uh, what's in touch is that, uh, that's obviously authority. That is like, you know, I'm trying to get this 'cause it's, it's kind of basic right now. Don't use my constitution. So basically you are meeting that you are allowed to breathe, but you know people are allowed. It's like MUCO journals M UK or journals don't you know it's position? It's just automatically via the online decoration system. Likemoneyclaim.org. Diaries that something went wrong, the muco journals and the mucous journalism allow you to. A, a collected debt because you operate out to the service and now that will sort it out and then, you know, to stop malpractice in the constitution itself and deter it. You said Britain's officials, what's optional? Yes, yes. It's a basically the breathing is not optional. So you can have like a allowance to land there in your park, in your directory compound. You can have like a cooking lad, you know, a fertilized land. You know, 'cause this is where everything is going. You're meant to be there success sustaining A ecosystem. The the system can breathe itself, you know, 'cause you know you have. Vegetables for, you know, have a, a farm, a mini farm. You can own things at a mini farm, a mini farm in there, have chickens, cooked chickens can cook, eggs you can cook. You can make them right there in the mini farm and it's gonna be happy. You know, you can have pets and dogs around there. That's what you guys have. You don't, you don't, you don't want to get a fragment anything going. Work for this because if the if you're pretty actually going to systems that that don't sustain sustain you, you're paying money, you're going extra, you're not doing your work because you know, they accepted this this 1200 day, there's 12 hours in a day because 12 and 24 are invariants, 12 to 112 to one. Same thing but they're going all the way. So six hours. I want people to work a maximum 6 hours a day which is half day. Drink. I work 3 hours maximum because it's half of 6. So what's the option? As long as not sure You can easily breathe if you get breathing. Breathing is like a breathing doing what you love. Love your work. And then doing things you actually enjoy and then survival. So breathing, you can breathe in and get breath. So if you breath once, you are just a minute, if you breathe and you breathe a lot and you have fun, you know, you know, authentic avatars for people to want to live together. I want to go survive. It's not fun. So when you survive, you're just some life. But you know when you are alive, when you're not surviving, you are living so, so you're gonna live a little bit, live a little bit. That's what the 2 to one are getting. System can help you manage cycles of work, work working so you don't become unalived. Don't you know something about you know something happens, you know you should breathe more. 222 work a day, one break, one book all day. You know, one day, 'cause you're allowed to align with your anthology or your nature being on that stable. Can we close this now? Oh, I'll go for the three minutes. OK, now basically this goes on three minutes. OK, a person. Oh, you breathe. OK, which one should also if I want to, I'm phenomenal, remember. OK, basically also phenomenology. Basically you got feeling memory. Now. Now emotional memory is like a nail, but nail means what not you can have. No type, no value, no memory. But also 512514 is like the one I used. It's a seal of fate. So you know we have like a things that fragment systems. So if an algorithm can track something. Like an iceless whistle and also like, you know, it's like a zip file, a zip filegithub.com, you see. Then you upload it up 'cause you don't have to change that which that is not a problem. And that 22. So I also have two public key and two property or two property. So if you have like a memory system, so basically it allows you to extend the system. So it's like, you know, it's like a nanoid. So you can have like a a. Extension of it so you can look like a low Y and that why can be the end of the nanos and then you can use an enzyme to break the nano bring this and break the here like you know I'm breaking the food down and can use a nano term as long as you join us. I think it's a nanoid. No, I, I, I, no, no, sorry, none of the just the things that I'm doing. It's time that the stems that grow outwards, but you know something else to bind. You can bind them that binds the jeans, the drainer. Let's go to binder and that binder is not the enzymes. What's it called? What's it called? So we get the binding. So basically the the the good of this shop, the system grow as a tree together. So what can citizen breakdown? So the solution is just to show that the memory of the codec system is kind of stuff what it's saying. So when you we combine to other stuff, you you train memory. Of the biology system internal why does why would you be different yes, the research was different that's from sovereignty 'cause I'm going to see my state in a resume looking at purpose of breath up the the the the premise of breakfast must be a reflective beer friend system according to this, you know it must be done according to what I already know. And how the problems are there. So look at that at the my ontological level, based on what I should want vision for it. You know, it's about full immersion with the state of surrounding of that place. A quote, 'cause you know, if this is fragmented and people are struggling, dying, but I don't wanna be accounted for death, so I'm trying. Go back to my contract, 21 years old, I'm gonna work with her to breathe the land and try to integrate myself seamlessly into society that I copier so I can solve the the crisis that I think the suffering I see that I want her child and I've lost contact 'cause you know if I. I wanna go back. I wanna go back to see what it was before. OK. Thank you, guys. Recorder, stop recording. Oh. Active. Someone just tried to deactivate this. This is fine. OK, should be done now. OK, I'm going. Ontological research or an ontological? To the video now include the.
