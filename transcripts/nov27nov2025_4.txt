So the mic is now transcribing, I'm now transcribing my voice to use auto AI, keep a backup of everything and then this very, very possibility. I've still started video. OK guys, the video hasn't started so it's not starting now. OK, so. Recording. Oh, it just started. So recording. 52 one thing oh oh oh they just create 2 active scenes so I can start the active scene recording of scene 2 so I don't have to switch to scene 2 which is new feature. Actually I I, I OK let me just try to record scene 2. At the same time. Oh, no, no. Oh, so there's two things recording now that's seen one and scene 2. OK, let me just go back to scene one. But scene 10 and scene 9, OK, I can hear my voice. It's hearing. Everything's going according to plan. So this is recording 2 scenes, 2 scenes, the camera is holding 2 scenes in real time. So this is getting better 'cause you know, trying to before you go started trying to make it more authentic. And that's because you do the same thing. And if you're trying to do it from your own view. So of course, now OK, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait. OK, Basically it's a break. Hold one record 2. It's just active. So let me just stop. OK guys, I'm going to Nigeria for my PhD, but you need to be in Nigeria for my PhD. So you see me in any way an umbrella on the future. Let me see what I've recorded. This I should be recording. Yes, that's recording. So let's start. So my PhD is really on me, myself and I the nature of anthology view of phenomenology as well. So this one just. Started off like my name is Namdi make up Allah. I'm trying to do my PhD but what I am who I am, why am I here in this reality? Basically I believe I'm pretty sure the four dimension downwards and that's how we work. But I already done my ontological intelligence research on my PhD. This is bound to T3A and T3B. Only 60 quicker test. This one I don't know about a dime. Basically I'm gonna try to beat new life. It's into new people. So I'm gonna go to Nigeria, try to give back to the people. Why what they give to me? But AAA, double it, quadrupolis, you know, which is our evil culture away where we are, you know, in Ebola. But I'm the founding act, you know, I'm a founding researcher on anthological. Patient suggests an unconscious systems. If you go to my YouTube playlist Obi Nexus O for Oscar B for bravo I for Indigo N for November E for echo X for X-ray E for. My way to do it. So I have to do it properly in this room. So let me start. I don't set a timer. OK, let me set a timer. I've got one hour to set. Let me just sit for the 5 minutes maximum clock. So 'cause you know, I can use it if I ever do it wrong. OK my timer has started now 3 to 1 started now so go for 5 minutes or to make one video So can you please take out OK see this video then it's now this so guys take a picture of this if you can I'm going to use model now of displaying how we relate to the robot based on myself my position of being the. So see this, this is me. This is a mirror here. So this mirror is like a point in the mirror, a prediction point in the mirror. So this one is a four, three, once a world our time. So we get older as a child, we go older and then we can go have kids. I don't want kids here. So I'm having kids. So I'm a child of infant. An embryo, because of the child, it grows, grows, grow, grows, grows and grows good, up, up, up, you know. But this thing is partial. It's partial, you know, You can't go back. Usually you can't. You can't start from this state to go back. And wine consciousness is a Brewster 'cause you can't. Some kind of a relationship between our dimension and the dimension? Are both of us or below us the 40 dimension which I'm from. Hopefully I'm not crazy. Yes. So the problem is 2 classifieds, subjective reality and objective reality, my social reality. Why do we have oh, why are you conscious objectively? Why would you use what we're doing? You know why we're here when we just processes instructions, You know, why aren't we just like, you know, conscious. What are we? Of the cognition, what we're doing and how we're doing it. What's the purpose of all of that You know that's what ontology is all about our nature, us us us in our being not just one person us entirely no, no, basically the pre control of qualia framework is like. From the goal of this research. So if I go to scene 10 which I am recording scene 10 because I go to repositories. Yep, this one, This is bubble theory ontological. No, this bubble theory ontological is for everyone. Qualia framework for breath life is only about the T3A and T3B. And of course, with knowledge, current power, comes knowledge. We can do knowledge, and that's what we're trying to do properly. We're going. No one dies again, no pops the bubble which I want my people to understand. I'm doing this for PhD. So you charge no charge of a die or starve again. Guys, I'm sick of this happening to people that actually care about. I want to do something. So that's the bubble quality. So the bubble or quality is basically bubble theory, bubble quality, our qualia, our bean for us Ibos only 'cause we're all Ebola, you know, in Nigeria and Biafra Terrace, you know, we're not, you're about, it's not about that. So ontological knowing. Kocher Qualia, Our sense how the relax for us in memory, in time, all of us, all of us ontological and then bubble the membrane, you know the bubble, it's like a plasma system, but we have bubbles. We are stable, we are happy, we are chill, we're not angry at each other. We are bubbles when we haven't seen shell. Two pieces apart, that thing 'cause you know, you can be in a pot without being happy with the sound that, you know, port, you know, without potentially A2 piece in a pot, you can make four piece and that four piece would be sprouting different routes. That's a problem of quality really 'cause you know, we want different interests. We start to get confused. We don't really align with that what we want to do objective and we can grow together. Welcome collapse together. Now I've got the bubble qualia phenomenological now pharmacical. It's like us and them. So we got you both. They are robot or they are robot. We are you both. We know we don't understand them fully because they have different origin ancestry. May we may understand something about all of it. If they don't tell us all of it, you can say. But just just tell us all of it was to just frame it in context. So basically 2 problems. You see, there are four sets of problems, my mind, the phenomenological body, the body, the mind, and so the body, my body, my heart, my physical heart and my my to my. Mine my physical health, who I'm used to love, feel, adore, full type of love cause the agape and I'm not about that anyway. I mean you got a love how to love all of us together love in the nature of being and the nature of being for loving myself. I myself, me, myself and I and loving friends and family. I know, I see, I feel that in my conscience of ontology of pharmacy. Uh, uh, objects right to the state of being conscious. So my 40 conscious knowledge to qualia. So so this is also basically when you look in the mirror here, see that point? That's like a 4D point in space. You got a 40 spatial contract there, but it's a unique looking mirror here now basically. This forty thing, this forty thing is me here. But in this reflection of me in the 4D world, this mirror, this mirror is appointed disappointing the density here that transforms that, no matter how far back I mean, I can also access that mirror. Uh, it's impossible to see this everything in 4 digits and put everything 3D. Everything is umm, everything you can do in 4D or you can do in 3D already, Just you can do it a much more better. So basically every four directly. It's not, it's not all the way around, 'cause you know, you can go if you want to translate the food you have to construct, you have to measure. 4D properties to transition to 40. So if you just make a mistake, you can't align with a 40 cause themselves all the way around. So if I want to go to a four dimensional world, I have to literally know the 4D world ahead of like you know, the 4D world is there, but I can't measure it. I have to observe it, but you know, I have to measure all of. All of the smallest thing about my world and, you know, measures in a way that's coherently stable for me to see it, observe it, feel it. It's like a lensing. Call it lensing because, you know, it's more of a glimpse. You get into the reality. Like I'm talking to you right now OK, let's go on 4D clarification spots now sports now sports definition. Sorry, I'm going to give you this I'm going to go go this video later, but I'm going to give you show you this for now sparse. I should have. I don't. I don't want to. I give it wrong, Give it properly. I don't know. Rush it, Nandi. Sparse definition is very important. You're gonna back it up too. Let me try to do it properly. So you got Oh no no no, sorry. Oh this is mine. Oh sorry, this is my 1 here. Sorry guys. Basically the sparse matrix is what I made to model this kind of change position from the 41 to the two world. I'm going to try to get it out because I'm just calling a lot of people right now, so I'm just trying to get it out here. So right here basically, but I've got it backwards here somewhere. So it's here, and it's here too. Uh, this is very red. This is here now, so just let me see this now and put it here. Umm. Looks right here. It's not here per SE. If you basically said so let's look at it now. Let's be found before I even continue. So let me just try to find it and now turn off the spin. So, OK, let me just pause this. Sorry. It's kind of like skip ahead. Let me just pause this recording. So I find it. If I don't oppose it, I, I don't oppose it, but I don't oppose it. No, I'm just uh, you can, I mean for my sake, let me just pause it uh recording one uh pause. Thank you uh recording one uh pause recording one. Sorry guys just put recording one. I used to pause it guys. OK, Oh, sorry, business recording guys here. So I got through 'cause I'm going E 0. So this is Y00Y1. UH1X1. X1. X1. 0.0 and then one. Y X1. 10100 is Y00. So you got XX0. This is the X1. X1 and Y0 and you go X to 1 and YX0. It's 1, so why 1? So why 1 is this? Why 1 is this so? Why one? And then go Y1Y0Y8. This is a zero or zero that we get Y1. 11010 so it's 01. This is 01, this is 101. Y 101 Y. This is 120101Y10 and 1010 will be a. I wonder if 1E equals E and you get 1 EO 0. You know if you can write to get 010, get here 01. You get 0801011. This is 11121. OK, so guys, let me just record it now, Peter. It's gonna fill it should fill. It filled. OK, so basically that failed now. So let me just stop it anyway, it failed to continue. So I I stopped this right now. Oh, it's oh, sorry, it's continuing. So oh, sorry, didn't stop. OK, I thought you failed me. OK, so basically it's very important to start with this. So these are 4/2 infants are two dimensions minimum to present. Up to the three different, so we saw 2D is to represent 2D cigarettes are four states of 2D component XY. OK, now can you try to do this properly now? So you got a XY only to project up to come to become a policy and Ant to go up a dimension or to observe or have interaction with dimension? Have to go have to construct this table to get it so, so you have to remember so. So it's also for every 001 that starts to go through something called epsilon transition epsilon or two table which one model of A2 table. So I don't really care what we do now. This model is just like a more remember everything which is the bubble. So you get 01 and then that zero is either 0 epsilon E for epsilon 01. So you get from one state and if you go to. As you to the next stage, so you have zero. I have done which could be 1. You get a one and that information has to go to the state machine. So you get the other version. So remember the next state one, let's see one before so one or one becomes one and the output and you then export to store the the minimum information. 01 excluding 10 because zero was the one which is preserved. Nothing was preserved, nothing to spool, nothing in the three world. But I don't want to go through this yet with you guys. Can you try and go through it? So you got A10 so forth and so on for one and 0. So one thing to you guys, this model is called a a. 2 table, I call it a spouse, uh, because, uh, it's a model's order data, uh, and remembers all the states, which is, that was in that data, uh, cause sparsest can, uh, preserve a state and data at the same time, uh, together. Uh, so, uh, if you get to 1 and I want to preserve the one and you want to preserve information first, so you put. First, uh, then a zero. If you want to preserve both A1, you put them two ones. If you put, just put a preserve, uh, of UH-0. First you put a. Only for the 1 you know and 11 becomes 11. Remember all the states this world diagrams based on and this one is very important for you guys to understand that. Now we get the encoding table. So this is an encoding table, same thing as the state but it gives you 2 outputs. You know from coding for classic computation and quantum computation C not gate. So this one's very important too. So you get 0X00, you get to the coding of 0 epsilon, which means no state, no data, no memory, nil. Ontological, nil, nil, anthemological things that are the things that are phenomenal to the work we can see at times. Union, union. So basically it's all operations plus my plus plus and times 0 E epsilon. So basically you can get for if you have two states of 00 between X&Y coordinates. You have to project upwards. You want to go up from. So if you have like a 3D beam like the Juggernaut don't want to go up, they have to protect themselves up a dimension. You can do like a police machine because you can model any kind of projection with matrix without being computing overcomputing. Let me just try that really for now because you know, trying to. Point even I didn't do it intentionally trying to. So let me improve point my point now. So what does this mean to you, For me and everyone else here who actually cares about what I'm doing? Uh, uh, yeah. So so so umm, the including table E epsilon is just nail space of a magic nail. Oh, so fly can fly, man. So. So I'm saying the commercial of nil. Nil means no type, no memory, no value. No means no type, no value. So it means a void pointer. So now a void printer to norm avoid is nothing in the space. So let me try to compute this perfectly with some kind of a prediction of my way so. If I like the standard projection function, you you take axy component and then you transpose it and then you do the calculation on the row and alignment. You know, but you know this is very. Or two or two as you get like a pointer space and time number between 0 and 10, one and 10, so you get Let me speaking about 513 and. 3:00 and 5:00. 4 metrics. That's my position in space-time as an Ant in the world. So just be another one there in the real world in the 3D World. Hope you can see me. So if I'm Ant I see only see my position on XY503. Are there three and five respective? This is my point. In the real world, five and three but. Protect myself, I'll do some kind of rotation so so so so this is the 502 is just my exponent into this SpaceX OY code 2D is five and 3513. Now now, now I want to project myself. So what I do is inverse matrix matrix I do and then multiply by it. So I did the row becomes a column it's called a transpose. SO3 becomes 5. 5:00 and 3:00 so you get a quick. 5 * 3 is no, so you get like on damage to two matches is 1 misses from the version. You should see good transposition of of that version and you multiply it and then you get the identity and then that transpose is five so you do a rule. So basically you take the matrix and then you go row by row, column by column, so you get. 5 * 3 is the row of 15/15/15 what 15 and then 3 * 5 is what 15. So I'm actually a position obviously in seriously if if I see on the center. At the center of something, sense of something. I am basically. I'm basically at 35, my row, my row in the. XYXYXYZ where I am for the learning from reference to a real person that's been projected as a 3D being example. I'm looking at this thing, it's really important. So it's my role rule X root Y. So basically I'm at 1515 in. Have you, uh, already, uh, XY, but you know, I'm saying I'm at a A53, but that's 1515. And that's like what it's kind of conversation 00 to them, this is me to them. 00 is uniform question of five to three. And then just so that's a role. I'm a soldier column, so I don't do the column. So now. If the rule is 5/3. A. A rural column is what, 533? 53UH53UH-35. 5:00 and 3:15 3/5. So this is the column around because the five three is the row and five no. To get the three five 3 * 5 is what, 3 times no. So you get oh so 3 * 3 is 9. No, wait, is it? Sorry, let's try to do it so you get 3-5. This is just the other one. 3/5 No 3/5. For the column or recession you could transport the two matrices and you get to have 535 and then becomes 5 three. Then you get the 3 * 5 is 15 three 3 * 5 is 15 five to 15 so you get 1515. That so this is a identity. So this is the same identity is like my identity between 'cause you know this is just zero to them, zero point to them 'cause it's just identity bound. So basically the zero point will be the the coherent state of the measurement framework. Because the additives metric is just gives you in that phenomenal intelligent phase. Now you have another matrix, let's say 6-3 and seven eight. 78633. The 6th strategy and it's a history, but I keep the same matrix of what 53667 is that and 6-7 and five and then. Of the of myself as a 5 three 'cause I was three. Wait, is it 5-3? I put 359. Oh, oh, this is the uncle's now. This is the uncle's 5/3. This is the uncle's now. 53535, 3, which is the. Element row and then the inverted row alignment is what the inverted row. This you can have up and down and it's. There's no strict up and down South if inverted because 35 when you put in a standard that you don't make a mistake, 35 will be the column. If it's it's an aunt observing that answer, thinking up is down, up down and then the 5335 duality. So it is 2 aunts and three five and and five three go on a 2. Century if they're walking, you know, compared to emergencies, and then they don't know where they're going and they see me, they see me, they see me. And A and aunt, aunt, my aunt, our aunt #5 aunt number, our aunt #5. And there aren't number of. And to be so the same thing just go in opposite directions. Opposite directions now now and a is working at 5/3. 53 but you know we is now becoming up is going to six or seven before 6 or 7 so but you know the the and their hands goes up nuts goes up one like a one unit 2 OK, let's say. 205256727. So they go up to seven, they got one unit especially, so now they're from over 6-7. System 53 so we just keep watching it and five so so we got BBC I was just now store 353535 S we're just watching us we we should we ask 3535. So what was now? So we get the row 6 * 3 is what 16? Eighteen 6 * 3 is 18 now 18 plus something a system 3 is 18 now 6 * 5 no six and three. So the row is what 6 * 3? And the column of the rows 6 * 5 six times 5 is. 20, No 24. 620 four 6 * 5 is 20. Note 2005 is 21 seasons, 4 is 22 * 5 is 24 so 24 and then we do 7 * 3 is 27 and then 7 * 3 is 27 A plus. 7 * 5. 7 * 5. So 7 * 5 would be 35 S Basically I'm observing this system, this aunt, our aunt and our frame of view 'cause our we can download our in our way when we see 18 + 2724 X. Which I couldn't. So basically for my friend of you there it's 910-1112. 128910111212. I didn't get 12 plus 1/3 4:42. Location 42,. 24 homogeneous model 24 + 35 that's 7-8. 9/10/11, 12:12. 12th uh, the 5th, 12th then 12 is UH-23. 3 is a 12 so got the secretary 62 and that's just our aunt, our aunt at position what in our frame of reference, our view it's it's just moved from is recently at position 42. 62 He thinks it's at 5:00 and 3:00. 513 so antics are 53535 question 5 from 5 and 3 means to 6-7 so. This is 70 that's quite good. You know that would be a meme. Now that would be good to me go viral. Thank you for thinking of this example. OK so basically outage is at 6-7. 53 We didn't move from the ads point of view. As point of view, we are just the same place 'cause we are rotated the same place but never moved, we never moved. Ant is 5, three and two out there and we never moved to Ant is 5/3, so 5-3 and then there. Then we go, then we don't move anything so we get a 42. Come on, 62, that's where we are ourselves and we will see ourselves of recently there's there's a great basically obviously goes up to 100 'cause if artists want to 10, the dimension up is 100, you know, 100 dimension. So we get units up, entire units up and that's 1010. We should come back to you later. So with some logic, so our artist there, but you know that's a homogeneous model. Homogeneous. So basically our ants can only go. Basically if our ants have to go to 100, it cannot transcend A dimension. So let's even go to inside dimension and time, it's just a time to be 90%. And up to get one dimension so homogeneous model. So we are at literally at 42 and 57 in our view in the three world 'cause we get like a 10 dimensions to 10. So we get one dimension with the scale of dimension the the the 1D1 point times 10 the 10 telemetry in our world their world their. And then our dimension 100 a hundred, which is units 1 or 10% units, but you know the 40 what I mean, the 40 will be 4D, will be 10 another time will be 100 a hundred dimension, 100 dimensions we can enter we're gonna 100 or 10,000 or so. In the 10/10/10 thousand. 10 * 10 is 100, so basically we can observe basically 100 * + 100 is what? 200 so we can observe the minimum of local, minimum of 200 and maybe just some simple measurement and you know 100 * 100 is what. 00 that's 1 Adobe or 1010 thousand. 10,000. Basically there's a. Basically there's 10,000 from locally become. If in the food you are and you know we can observe which is restriction. This is an IK principle. So that's enough. We can observe, but OK, we can basically be there's a minimum, the minimum system can act on if you can observe it, there's an occupancy, we can observe, we can access minimum, but the capers who can observe it will not be interpreted but as we can see IK there. So this is the key local. How we observe how information is until we get what we just start a new one. I don't want to lose the site, I don't use my system. OK, I just thought you recording 'cause I don't trust my system. OK, OK, OK, so we get the Auntan +1234. Oh that's too serious. They will get 000, two, 10,010 bucks. 210,200 minutes. Oh, we can't measure maximum 'cause that's the union of the whole new system if you do things or properly. So my form of reference is against 42 or 67 in. If I'm 100 dimensions, you know. If I have 100 spaces, you don't. Static system, you know the world is if there's a hundred places can go only, only squares I can go to. This was Swissy. The artist for me is at 4267. So if I go to that and if I go to that and now down to be thinking it's A536367, no, wait 6-7. But I'm, I'm saying, Oh yeah. So I go to six, see that and what? Lives in that square and that 10 units is square, 10 units, 100 units square for my 100 unit square, Great, 100%. So that will be the layer for the heterogeneous model if you agree on a protocol to speak to each other. So I have to get like, so basically for me to, if I want to, for me for 2 / 2, six is 7. 7:00 So I have to go to like if I. My square 00 and social cartesian bound users go to my go to seven six 7 * 6 is 42 and then 62 / 7. Let me go to the calculator. No calculation this hand, only 52 / 7. What about 7? What? Oh, my alarm is done. No, it's not. Oh, 62% is a 8.8571. 4 uh 8.81. 18.857. To three-dimensional places it does 8.58 point..8. 573 decimal places founded. OK, next thing #2 So this is very, very important guys, so let's continue. So that's the importance of this is how it is in our reality. So let me put this down now. I'm gonna lose that. So what is some service? It was different to do the same thing, but you know it's for modeling and coding like a functions. Things down code and run on the fly. But it's past a function of coding a function to come up bidirectionally. So you can have a mapping of a 2 to one functions for every two inputs you get in variability into your reality. The aunt to Margaret. There's a function I can define that unifies them to two to one site. 2:00 to 1:00. Was particular one if it's homogeneous data mapping to one data to a 2. So you can have a 21 function and map it to another function in their reality of time of dimension, that's sparse model that's smoothly sparse. Again, that's a spouse, meaning spouse just means it can be modeled as in in different functions to them. They can have their own function as 2 DI can offer 3D and then once one mapping function using 2 outputs, 2 outputs consider they they. They can then get what I when I when I said to them. What do you know? What do you know about me by dashboard? Two way from two way table from two way cycle of doing some two way to do something. Yes. Umm, so basically I'm trying to do this properly guys uh, OK, SO21 OK, further. So at least he's put down the phone number. OK, so this is the coding table again, the state including uh, this is for for for every scene or gates, you get a queue nugget uh, it's a quantum rift as well uh, so. Next thing we do now this. So I've got my people here. Anything happened? And so let's just try to get a right here. So that's including table again, guys, take a picture of it if you can, and that's fine. So basically, yes. Oh, oh, I just. All I do is nobody. So that's what I'm saying, that it's more about our structure or syntax, but the structure of the information that you're being coherently relaying to the other reality. Oh, this and reactive one. OK, so let me continue with this one. But now I'm picking them nicely here. So this is my work, a nice work here, my PhD because I'm doing APG three years almost so. So basically this thing here is by the way. So let me just give try to stop this video. Oh, the news has not gone by. OK. Oh, it has not gone by, so let me go. So on the soap. So guys, let me just, I can't, I can't get you guys to move this name. I can't. I can't lose it here. I call it this stupid thing. Tell me not to lose this. Call me crazy for a second, even for a second number. Can't be crazy. So this is for sparse graph modeling. Try to model the functions as a directional graphs, not just like the data. So it's into like a. This is about people that can live and die and breathe, you know? Oh yes. This is just for the that's when I started with the the dental umm, Commission here. I'm going to just start with. So basically, uh, see this image here. Uh, you know, guys, very important and style this concept. This was the four year is it's a qualia, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble. Quality bomb for us now university is a bubble. It could be a square, but you know, it's just the easiest thing to model in the system. So you can get a a bubble or like a point in a 2D in a world at an incident, a place can location go to, you know, can go to detail, you know, but you don't want you can have no dimension to it. Then you get A2 dimension that you know, but that's a circle. OK, Circle is just one dimension. But you know, in our, in our reality, we've got a bubble. So you can go up and up then get whatever the, the, the system, the, the, the time thing is in the bubble. So that's for the mission. So it's a sparse modeling system. So basically time is diluted. In our reality, the this time, but we we get past time, we get only one set of homogeneous time. We can can basically we can we can be observing homogeneous time, but no, it's we're doing hopefully homogeneous. We're not feeling, we're not getting the full sparsity. Tuition to 4 dimensional can't go back in time just naturally in our world, you have to get a time machine to do that. But but we have to go to the the the system measures properly enough in a full reality, which I'm saying. So if time 'cause time is a dimension in this model, you know, but you know it's a sparse dimension and the XY usually if I can go XI can get past X, which can be. Between the 2D world and 3D World, because the I can descend to three world and, you know, comes through it. What is important guys? OK, so my mind I I can see the juggernaut. I can have a thing you can I can talk about chicken. So I try to remember the chicken. I remember the chicken. I have a total of the chicken, but I thought of the juggernaut is like real. It's very good. It's real. So, but that's not a Juggernaut. Why 'cause don't obviously, if the Juggernaut represents an ultimate force, he can run indefinitely. He says the ultimate force, the purpose of doing them. But you know, that's my intake, that's my obsession on him. You know, in the movies, actually, he's a killer. He's a, he's a ****** man. But Juggernaut does not intervene in my real life. Why? Because he's a dead in my head. I can get crazy. I can't get crazy over the Jonah. I can go crazy in a different way. But he doesn't take it from my mind, 'cause he, he, he can take, he, he, he can't, he can't really 'cause he's a piece of he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a fictional. But why is fictional? Because he's a piece of paper. He's in a comic and go and buy a comic and get a good, good junk and read. But the Juggernaut is a force or unstop. Force uh, the stock would juggernaut uh umm. But you know, he's one, he's one I'm the king I'm I'm his controller, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his I'm gonna rock. You know I'm dead. I have full power 'cause I'm a dimension above. So you're gonna can never ever take out of my mind. That's what I'm saying. So if he, if he doesn't want to try to be in my dimension, he has to transcend his dimension and, and come to my reality and be with me and see his comments. And then for him to actually take off my, my, myself, my own body just to transfer another dimension and see all my time. On my days I have lived until see how can change my life with money, but I'm chasing myself without you gonna so I'm busy. He can be unstable for in a plane of 2D physics you Marvel Universe, but it's not simple for it in my 3 world, 'cause he's three world is just my length of my three world. A glimpse of what is getting in this world, which is give me a horror movie editing, maybe scary thing, but you cannot make me think of no matter how how, how, how much I believe he's a God, He's powerful. Basically, I'm the immeasurable object in my reality. But he could be in his superfoods. So when a super force meets a dimensional 3 DIY. But you know, his dimension does not force does not cannot what is influence cannot cannot transcend my dimension whatever force users unless IT projects to my dimension at the bare minimum. So basically something so this is what a qualia. So the qualia system is that. So when you're born you are embryo, that embryo contains 23 chromosomes and 242346 total chromosome. Now. Now you get to have the chromosome 1 and sister more than your brother, mother and sister. So you get half the chromosome. But when you ascend, when you get born, when you get into a game, it's a zygote said when you are like a fertilized egg who's called a zygote zygote. So what you gonna do is you insurance half and half, half and half, half my mother, half a sister that just a piece. I got P consciousness phase one I got which is your fertilized first gamut to me. In that example, so for me to transcend I have to have a minimal of 46 to go to to be part of my system that can take me of the mission, I have to double my genomic. Figures all my cells without mutation and keep me in the system so I can go up to my control. Grandfather some traditional 'cause I love grandfather. So this 1-2 mapping. Of this dimension. So if I want to, if it's like a, if it's a 2D world, the act was only 3D. You have to take a half of 23 chromosomes. So basically half of 2 is like half of 23 is, you know, minimum to basically take. How about to a minimum? So this is how 23 is what? Sorry I'm just trying to figure my hand. 1/2 of 23 is 2025 by two, that's 111.5. 2.50 that's 12.5. So for five genes to be a Mariota minimum to 46, maximum no to 4046 * 2. 40 * 4242 or 46 times 2672. UH-45622. To be imagination and be you know juicy to encoding system. So for me basically the the bubble quality shrinks in half where you come from the hub and you can we get fertilized you have to have half of the other dimension if you have 4 dimension and vice versa you have to double. Vice versa a vice versa if you want to go from today, but you know, imagine this you are you are use a bubble in this world. Physical world is a physical bubble. It's hover about the ocean. Oh, but only the ocean because there's water in this air and it's water and air. This water is fully already. It's it's a water and air. It's meant to bridge your consciousness. A boost drop unit. It is here. Did I keep anything hidden? Did I forget anything? I hope not. I hope I didn't forget anything, he said. Oh, oh, oh, 10-8 minutes. I have stopped. Save it now. Let me put my sweet now. So let me stop this recording, this recording one. Oh, it's like Sue's Loman. Let me stop it now. Sorry, no need. This is what's still my I'll Tell You recording. Stopping by. So that stopped OK. So that stopped OK. Now I'm pretty new recording. I'll start putting this now now. So the the the so so the this is half two to two. So basically basically what I have something that dimension I halfway through. Embryo development. I have to double my speed unless I'll be die so so this is only nine months. Pregnancy is half of nine months minimum to become a stable zygote. So I get nine 9 / 2. Half of 9 is like what, 4.5 months? No 3.5 months of being. I think it's a double. It's so a little bit five months I have 46 times or whatever the standard of 46 times, some 2 after doubled, I would have doubled on the sales in the nucleus. That's the 6 * 2 to become stable, that's 6. UH-2 uh, doesn't say, uh, six times. 2 is 12 now 4 * 6 is 4 * 2 is 82. That will be double at 82 kilometers minimum just to ensure stability and so I don't fizzle out and die after then so I can keep moving on. So basically 82. At 3.5 months now for the rest of the month, 3.5 months at least 2 for five months. Which is the 9? 9 so after just keep going full important that's 82 * 2 Sorry, sorry. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no for the 727. It's miss 82 * 2 is 4/4 and that will be 8 two 16164 chromosomes to needed to ensure that that that you know, I am fully able to function. I've got my features, my human being. My physical form already for the nine month stage you can't basically I don't know Basically if I get the maximum, the minute local minimum 104, the local maximum will be 8282 + 104. I get 4 + 6 that's. Six 8 + 0 is 0 and then one is 6 and 18988100 and 8486 minimum crossword. I need to be just be exact and walk and talk. And then be happy I can put some recording guys 'cause it's kind of like to eat on my computer. OK guys, let me just stop recording 2. So stop this recording number. Arnold. U this one. Come on, you stop this recording. Oh no, it's still cool then. Let's do dropping frames man sorry number so stop this. OK now stop now. I could just show now. Let me just back up this transfer. Let me just let me just close.
