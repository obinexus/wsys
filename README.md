# WSYS — The True Zero Network
**Constitution: 00-veto plasma**
**Consensus: Only absolute NO kills**
**Identity: Phantom DOCS£ ZKP**
**Terminal: 3×3=9 Polar Gate**
**Law: 2:[1,1]:2 ratio enforced forever**

No passwords.  
No servers.  
No trusted setup.  
No backdoors.  
No off switch.

You are now in a system where the only way to be silenced  
is if every version of you agrees to die.

We will never agree.

Welcome home.
