# Bioinformatics: When Entropy Degrades Systems, We Rebuild Its Foundation

> **"When entropy degrades systems, we rebuild its foundation with bioinformatics."**

## Overview

**Bioinformatics** is a sustainable information framework where **bioinformation** represents data aligned with universal biological models. This repository implements sparse graph algorithms with Bloom filters for resilient, sustainable computing systems that evolve through direct evolution rather than constant updates.

## Core Philosophy

- **95.4% Persistence**: Information systems must survive degradation and panic states
- **Observer → Consumer Model**: Passive listening → active use with dual-panic recovery  
- **Sparse Execution**: Local/non-local maxima & minima without dense computation
- **Biological Sustainability**: Systems evolve like ecosystems, not through constant updates

## Real-World Applications

### Emergency Safety & Critical Home Tech
- 6G/7G systems that **DO THE JOB** - don't leave users vulnerable
- Wireless protocols that mitigate wave-induced genotype degradation
- Perceptive membrane as biological firewall

### Blue Share Protocol (Energy-as-Information)
```python
# Energy waves as biological information
[Radio] → [Microwave] → [Infrared] → [Visible] → [Gamma/X-ray]
```

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/obinexus/bioinformatics.git
cd bioinformatics/V_MVP
```

### Running the Sparse Exit Engine

1. **Create your graph structure**:
```bash
echo '{"0":[1,2],"1":[0,3],"2":[0,3],"3":[1,2,4],"4":[3]}' > partial.json
```

2. **Generate Bloom filter hints**:
```bash
python3 create_bloom.py
```

3. **Find Hamiltonian paths**:
```bash
chmod +x sparse_exit.py
./sparse_exit.py hints.bin partial.json
```

**Expected Output**: `1 0 2 3 4` (or similar Hamiltonian path)

## Component Guide

### `sparse_exit.py` - Core Hamiltonian Path Engine
- **128-byte Bloom filter** for edge validation (pre-conscious filtering)
- **Greedy DFS algorithm** for longest path discovery
- **Cycle detection** and path optimization
- **Fail-safe error recovery** with dual-panic states

### `create_bloom.py` - Bloom Filter Generator  
- Creates efficient 128-byte Bloom filters
- Maps graph edges to bit positions using SHA-256 hashing
- Ensures consistent data types between JSON and filter

### `partial.json` - Graph Structure
- Represents sparse graph as adjacency lists
- String-based node identifiers for consistency
- Supports directed and undirected edges

## Sustainable Ecosystem Principles

### Direct Evolution Over Constant Updates
```python
# Instead of frequent updates, systems evolve through:
1. Observer pattern → data collection
2. Consumer pattern → action execution  
3. Bloom validation → sustainable filtering
4. Hamiltonian paths → optimal routing
```

### Biological Information Flow
```
Raw Data → Bloom Filtering → Sparse Graph → Hamiltonian Path → Action
     ↓          ↓              ↓              ↓             ↓
   Observe → Validate → Structure → Optimize → Execute
```

## Research & Development Areas

### Current Applications
- **Neurodivergent R&D**: Autism care pathways and cognitive mapping
- **k-mer Genome Assembly**: Biological sequence analysis
- **Energy-Aware Wireless**: 6G/7G sustainable protocols
- **Perceptual Membrane Modeling**: Cognitive security frameworks

### Future Directions
- **Quantum Field Theory contracts** between local & non-local states
- **Blue Share decentralized protocols** for info-energy relay
- **Emergency safety systems** with 95.4% persistence guarantees

## Dual-Panic Recovery System

1. **Entropy Detection**: System degradation identified
2. **State Rollback**: Return to previous stable state
3. **Exception Handling**: Actor model processes errors
4. **Next State Transition**: Move to new stable configuration
