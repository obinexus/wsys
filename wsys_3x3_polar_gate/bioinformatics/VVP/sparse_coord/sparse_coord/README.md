# PLP-128 Sparse Coordinate Functor

## What This Is

A **real-time, zero-allocation** coordinate converter between:

- **Cartesian** `(x, y)`  
- **Polar** `(r, θ°)`

Built for **bioinformatics**, **sparse geometry**, and **real-world navigation** — using **PLP-128** (Phenomenological Lensing Principle, 128-byte Bloom).

## Why It Exists

> **Third-person**: *obinexus needed a system that works whether the data is in polar or cartesian — without rewriting code.*

> **First-person**: *I get lost in forests. I need my phone to know where I am — even with 1 KB left. This is that system.*
